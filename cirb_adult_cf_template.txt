Informed Consent Template for Cancer Treatment Trials
(English Language)
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Your doctor will explain the clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who choose to participate. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. If you have any questions, you can ask your doctor for more explanation.
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?

CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop safely. 
It is important to tell the doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the treatment can be evaluated by your doctor. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.
The doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.

WHAT SIDE EFFECTS OR RISKS CAN I EXPECT FROM BEING IN THE STUDY? 
You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the chemotherapy, although in some cases there are prolonged or even permanent side effects from stem cell transplantation. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away. There also is a risk of death from the treatment.
You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While doctors hope the chemotherapy will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof of this yet. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about chemotherapy as a treatment for cancer.  This information could help future cancer patients.
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DO NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Your other choices may include:
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study
• Taking part in another study
• Getting no treatment
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.  
Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.



WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?

WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Taking part in this study is your choice.  You may choose either to take part or not to take part in the study.  If you decide to take part in this study, you may leave the study at any time.   No matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you and you will not lose any of your regular benefits.  Leaving the study will not affect your medical care.  You can still get your medical care from our institution.
We will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study.

HOW WILL YOUR PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?

We have rules to protect information about you.  Federal and state laws and the federal medical Privacy Rule also protect your privacy.  By signing this form you provide your permission, called your “authorization,” for the use and disclosure of information protected by the Privacy Rule.

The research team working on the study will collect information about you.  This includes things learned from the procedures described in this consent form.  They may also collect other information including your name, address, date of birth, and information from your medical records. This could include information about HIV and genetic testing, or treatment for drug or alcohol abuse or mental health problems.

The research team will know your identity and that you are in the research study.  Other people at Johns Hopkins, particularly your doctors, may also see or give out your information. We make this information available to your doctors for your safety.  If you think this study might affect your clinical care, please inform your doctor. 

People outside of Johns Hopkins may need to see or receive your information for this study.  Examples include government agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration), safety monitors, other sites in the study and companies that sponsor the study.
Organizations that may look at and/or copy your medical records for research, quality assurance, and data analysis include:

• National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups
• Representatives of the NCI, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 
• Other U.S. and international governmental regulatory agencies involved in keeping research safe for people
• The Johns Hopkins Medicine IRB
• The Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) of the National Cancer Institute
• The Pediatric Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) of the National Cancer Institute

We cannot do this study without your authorization to use and give out your information.  You do not have to give us this authorization.  If you do not, then you may not join this study.

We will use and disclose your information only as described in this form and in our Notice of Privacy Practices; however, people outside Johns Hopkins who receive your information may not be covered by this promise or by the federal Privacy Rule.  We try to make sure that everyone who needs to see your information keeps it confidential – but we cannot guarantee that your information will not be re-disclosed.

The use and disclosure of your information has no time limit. You may revoke (cancel) your permission to use and disclose your information at any time by notifying the Principal Investigator of this study by phone or in writing.  If you contact the Principal Investigator by phone, you must follow-up with a written request that includes the study number and your contact information.  The Principal Investigator can be reached by phone at Insert phone number or by sending a letter to:  



If you do cancel your authorization to use and disclose your information, your part in this study will end and no further information about you will be collected. Your revocation (cancellation) would not affect information already collected in the study, or information we disclosed before you wrote to the Principal Investigator to cancel your authorization.
A Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained for this study from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). 
This Certificate provides that the group conducting this study cannot be forced (for example, by court subpoena) to disclose information that may identify you in any federal, state or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative or other proceeding.  




You should know that a Confidentiality Certificate does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about you or your involvement in this research. If an insurer or employer learns about your participation and obtains your consent to receive research information, then we may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this information.  This means that you and your family must also actively protect your privacy.
You should also understand that your doctor and the group conducting this study may take steps, including reporting to authorities, to prevent you from seriously harming yourself or others.
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this web site at any time.
WHAT TREATMENT COSTS WILL BE PAID IF YOU ARE INJURED IN THIS STUDY?
Johns Hopkins and the federal government do not have programs to pay you if you are hurt or have other bad results from being in the study.  However, medical care at Johns Hopkins is open to you as it is to all sick or injured people.  

• If you have health insurance:  The costs for any treatment or hospital care you receive as the result of a study-related injury will be billed to your health insurer. Any costs that are not paid for by your health insurer will be billed to you. 

• If you do not have health insurance:  You will be billed for the costs of any treatment or hospital care you receive as the result of a study-related injury.

By signing this form you will not give up any rights you have to seek compensation for injury.
