PURPOSE: The purpose of this form is to explain your treatment options with a  drug, device or biologic  called  insert name .    Insert name  is investigational.  This means that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved its use in humans.  Usually, patients can only receive an investigational drug or device by participating in a research study.  This option is not available to you.   However, in an emergency, the FDA will sometimes allow patients to receive the investigational drug or device without having to be in a study. This type of treatment is called Emergency Use.  If you sign this consent form, you will be given this drug or device to treat your condition.

RISKS:   Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks related to this treatment . 
        
BENEFIT:   Describe any anticipated benefits      
        
ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES AVAILABLE:  Describe any alternative procedures available to the patient  
        
FINANCIAL INFORMATION:  Describe what costs the patient may incur with treatment and who will be responsible for paying these costs  

INJURY OR ILLNESS:  In the event of illness or injury resulting from this procedure, please contact the investigator.  If treatment is required immediately, please go the emergency room and contact the investigator afterwards.    Payment for treatment will be your own responsibility.  

PATIENT RIGHTS:  Your decision to receive this treatment is voluntary and you may refuse to participate, or withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits.
