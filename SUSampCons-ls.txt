SAMPLE CONSENT
For Research on Leftover Specimens 

DESCRIPTION:  You are invited to participate in a research study on breast cancer.  We plan to study the effects of drugs on molecules found in breast tissue.

PROCEDURES: You are scheduled to have surgery to remove tumor tissue from your breast and we would like your permission to study any tissues left over after surgery that would normally be thrown away.  This study will not change your medical treatment or surgical procedure.  

After we complete our initial tests, we would like to save the leftover tissue for future research on breast cancer.  The tissue will be frozen and will be stored with a number assigned to it instead of your name.  The number will be linked to your name, which means you can withdraw from this study at any time.  

The future use of your tissue may result in new products, tests or discoveries which may have potential commercial value.  Donors of tissues do not retain any property rights to the materials.  As such, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.
The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests.
