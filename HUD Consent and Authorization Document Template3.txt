BACKGROUND:  Include a description of the HUD and describe why it is being used.  Describe why current therapies are not satisfactory and why an alternative treatment or approach will be used. Include a statement that the FDA has approved the device for humanitarian use.

Example:  You are being asked to allow the use of a HUD called <<insert name of HUD>>.  This consent form explains how the device will be used.  Please read it carefully and take as much time as you need.  Please ask questions at any time about anything you do not understand.  We will explain what other treatment could be given other than the HUD.  You should understand those options before you sign this form. 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved humanitarian use of <<insert name of HUD>> to provide treatment for patients who have problems with <<insert name of disease or injury>> and who have failed other treatments. You are eligible to use <<name of HUD>> because you have <<name of disease or injury>> and you have not improved with available treatments.

PROCEDURES:  Include a description of the procedures that will be followed chronologically using lay language, short sentences, and short paragraphs. Provide a timeline description of the procedures that will be performed, all hospitalizations, and all outpatient visits.  

Add information regarding pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential, if required. Indicate the frequency of pregnancy testing. 

Example:  If you agree to the use of <<insert name of HUD>>, you will <<describe procedures>>.  Your expected treatment time will be <<enter timeline>>. 

RISKS:  State that the HUD has not been proven effective for this use.  Include a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects the participant may experience for each procedure and drug (including likely results if the treatment should prove ineffective).  List all side effects, no matter how rare, that are life altering or potentially life altering. 

REPRODUCTIVE RISKS:  If there are reproductive risks, please include a section which includes the following:
1. State that there may be unforeseeable risks to the participant (or to the embryo or fetus) if the participant is or becomes pregnant during their participation.
2. List the acceptable methods of birth control for this procedure.
3. Describe what action will occur in the event of pregnancy (i.e. follow-up of pregnancy outcome, removal of the device, etc.)

BENEFITS:  This section should describe the benefits to the participant which may reasonably be expected from the device.  The description of benefits to the participant should be clear and not overstated to avoid coercion. If no direct benefit is anticipated, that should be stated.  

Example: We cannot promise any benefits if you receive this device. However, possible benefits include <<list benefits>>.  We hope that this device will help you.  However, this cannot be guaranteed.  

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES:  Describe any alternative procedures or courses of treatment that might be advantageous to the participant.  To enable a rational choice about participating, participants should be aware of the full range of options available to them. 

Example: If you do not want to receive this device, there are other choices such as <<list alternatives>>, or you may choose to not receive this device. 

PERSON TO CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS AND DEVICE-RELATED INJURY:  Explain whom participants should contact for answers to any questions, complaints, and concerns about the device or related matters.  Include the name of the P.I. and a telephone number with 24-hour availability.  Names of co-investigators may be included as well.  If the 24-hour number is a pager or the hospital operator, include further instructions for contacting the investigator.

Include specific information as to whom the participant should contact in case of a device-related injury.  This should include name(s), telephone number(s), and when the person(s) listed may be contacted.  If applicable, provide information about who to contact if the participant has questions about the billing of costs for the device.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD:
Include the following statement verbatim:

Contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if you have questions regarding your rights as a HUD device recipient. Also, contact the IRB if you have questions, complaints or concerns which you do not feel you can discuss with the investigator.

DEVICE-RELATED INJURIES:
Include the following statement verbatim:

If you are injured as a result of the use of <<insert name of HUD>>, the University of Utah can provide you with medical care.  However, you and/or your insurance company will be billed for the costs of treatment.  Neither the University of Utah, nor the FDA, nor the government has any program that would pay the costs of the complications of the procedures required or for the use of <<insert name of HUD>>.

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION:  State that participation is voluntary.  Indicate that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled.  Also indicate that the participant may discontinue participation at any time and still receive the same standard of care that he or she would otherwise have received.  

Example: It is up to you to decide whether or not you will receive this device.  If you decide to take part you will be asked to sign this consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. This will not affect the relationship you have with the investigator or staff nor standard of care you receive.  If you decide to withdraw, please contact the investigator so that appropriate arrangements can be made for your withdrawal.

UNFORESEEABLE RISKS:  State that receiving the device may involve risks to the participant which are currently unforeseeable. 

Example: In addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect. 

RIGHT OF INVESTIGATOR TO WITHDRAW:  Describe foreseeable circumstances under which the participant’s participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the participant’s consent.

Example: The investigator can withdraw you without your approval.  Possible reasons for withdrawal include <<list reason(s) why the participant may be withdrawn>>. 

COSTS TO PARTICIPANTS:  Costs related to the device should be explained.  If applicable, state that the participant may want to check whether their health insurance will cover certain costs.  When costs will be billed to either the participant and/or the insurance company, statements such as “will be billed to you or your insurer in the ordinary manner” are preferred.

Example:  All costs associated with this device will be billed to you or your insurance company in the ordinary manner.  Your insurance company may not pay for the costs associated with this device.  Therefore, these costs <<state who will be responsible e.g. “will be your responsibility” or “will be paid by the sponsor” or “the sponsor has agreed to pay $XX”, etc.>>.  
Example:  The parts of your care that would normally be done as standard treatment such as <<list procedures or refer to the procedures identified as standard of care in the “Procedures” section>> will be billed to your insurance company.
