CONSENT FORM REFERENCE TO MEDIA RECORDS RELEASE FORM

When using a separate Media Records Release Form for photographs, audio, and/or video recordings made as part of the research, the main study consent form should include a brief reference/ explanation for this, e.g.:
	
	"I may want to use some of the photographs, audio, or video recordings of you in public presentations related to the research.  There is a Media Records Release Form attached that outlines several possible uses and asks for your specific consent to use these items in each way.  If you agree to allow these items to be used after this research study is over, please read, initial, and sign the Media Records Release Form in addition to this consent form.  I will not use any photographs, recordings, or other identifiable information about you in any future presentation without your consent."

Please note:  If photographic/audio/video recordings will be used only for transcription of original study data, and only the lead investigator or research team members will have access to those recorded materials, then a Media Records Release Form is not needed.  In such cases, the researcher's intent to photograph or record should be disclosed in the main study consent form, along with information about restricted use and access of the photos/recordings, as well as when they will be destroyed and/or how long they will be retained.
