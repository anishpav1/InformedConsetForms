Compensation[slk15] 
You will not be offered payment for being in this study.  

OR[slk16] SOMETHING LIKE

You will be get $____ for each completed study visit.  If you do not finish the study, you will be paid for the visits you have completed. You will receive $____ total, if you complete all study visits.

Other Treatment Outside this Study[I17]
If you decide not to enter this study, there is care available to you outside of this research.  [List the major standard care options and/or possibility of other studies]  The study doctor will discuss these with you.  You do not have to be in this study to be treated for [condition].

Confidentiality
Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will keep any research records that it creates private to the extent that this is required to do so by law.  Whenever possible, a study number, rather than your name, will be used on study records.  Your name and other identifying information will not appear when we present or publish the study results.

Study records can be opened by court order.  They also may be provided in response to a subpoena or a request for the production of documents. [WK18]

Certificate of Confidentiality
There is a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health for this Study.  The Certificate of Confidentiality helps us to keep others from learning that you participated in this study.  Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will rely on the Certificate of Confidentiality to refuse to give out study information that identifies you.  For example, if Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital received a subpoena for study records, it would not give out information that identifies you.

The Certificate of Confidentiality does not stop you or someone else, like a member of your family, from giving out information about your participation in this study.  For example, if you let your insurance company know that you are in this study, and consent to give the insurance company research information, then the investigator can’t use the Certificate to withhold this information. This means you and your family also need to protect your own privacy.

The Certificate does not stop Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital from making the following disclosures about you:

• Giving state public health officials information about certain infectious diseases,
• Giving law officials information about abuse of a child, elder person or disabled person.
• Giving out information to prevent harm to you or others.
• Giving the study sponsor or funders information about the study, including information for an audit or evaluation[WK19]. 

Medical Record
If you are or have been an Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital patient, you have an Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital medical record.  If you are not and have never been an Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital patient, you do not have one.   An Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital medical record will be made for you if an Emory or St. Joseph’s provider or facility gives you any services or procedures for this study.  Copies of the consent form/HIPAA authorization that you sign will/will not [WK20]be put in your Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital medical record.  

Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital may create study information about you that can help with your care.  For example, the results of study tests or procedures.  These study results will/will not [WK21]be put in your Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital medical record. Anyone who has access to your medical records will be able to have access to all the study information placed there.  The confidentiality of the study information in your medical record will be protected by laws like the HIPAA privacy rule.  State and federal laws may not protect the research information from disclosure. 

We will take reasonable steps to keep a copy of the consent and HIPAA authorization forms you sign out of Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital’s medical records system.  If we aren’t successful in keeping these forms out, despite our efforts, we will take steps to remove them.  If they cannot be removed, we will take steps to limit access to them. 
[WK22]
Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital do not control results from tests and procedures done at other places, so these results will not be placed in your Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital medical record. They will likely not be available to Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital to help take care of you.  Emory and St. Joseph’s do not have control over any other medical records that you may have with other healthcare providers.  Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will not send any test or procedure results from the study to these providers.  If you decide to be in this study, it is up to you to let your health providers know. 

The researchers will/will not [WK23]be looking at the results of these test and procedures to make decision about your personal health or treatment.  [For this study, those items include: ][WK24]

A designated record set is data that includes medical information or billing records that your health care providers use to make decisions about you. If it is necessary for your health care, your health information will be provided to your doctor. 

We may remove identifying information from your PHI.  Once we do this, the remaining information will not be subject to the Privacy Rules.  Information without identifiers may be used or disclosed with other people or organizations and/or for other purposes besides this study.  

In Case of Injury[slk46]

OPTION 1:  The sponsor may choose not to pay for Subject Injury Costs for any subject, no matter if the subject is insured, or how he/she is insured.  
[s47]
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital would help you to get medical treatment.   Emory, St. Joseph’s Hospital, and the sponsor have not, however, set aside any money to pay you or to pay for this medical treatment. The only exception is if it is proved that your injury or illness is directly caused by the negligence of an Emory, St. Joseph’s Hospital, or sponsor employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. 
If you become ill or injured from being in this trial, your insurer will be billed for your treatment costs.  If you do not have insurance, or if your insurer does not pay, then you will have to pay these costs.  
If you believe you have become ill or injured from this research, you should contact Dr. __ at telephone number ___. You should also let any health care provider who treats you know that you are in a research study. 
OPTION 2:  The sponsor may choose to pay for Subject Injury Costs for all subjects, no matter if the subject is insured, or how he/she is insured. [s48]
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital would help you get medical treatment.  You should let the study doctor know right away that you are ill or injured.  If you believe you have become ill or injured from this study, you should contact Dr. __ at telephone number ___. You should also let any health care provider who treats you know that you are in a research study. 
If you get ill or injured as the direct result of being in this study, the sponsor will pay the costs for your medical treatment of the illness or injury if it:
(a) is not a medical condition that you had before you started the study;
(b) is not the result of the natural progress of your disease or condition;
(c) is not caused by your failure to follow the study plan; and  
(d) is not proved to be directly caused by the negligence of an Emory, St. Joseph’s Hospital, or sponsor employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. 
Your insurance will be billed for any costs of medical treatment for your injury or illness that the sponsor does not pay.  Your insurer may be told that you are in a research study. If you do not have insurance, or if your insurance does not pay, then you will have to pay these costs. 
Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital have not set aside any money to pay you or to pay for your treatment if you get ill or injured from being in the study.  The only exception to this policy is if it is proved that your injury or illness is directly caused by the negligence of an Emory, St. Joseph’s Hospital, or sponsor employee. 
OPTION 3:   The sponsor may choose to pay for Subject Injury Costs for uninsured subjects or subjects with Medicare/Medicaid and to pay any part of Subject Injury Costs for privately insured subjects that are not covered and/or paid by their private insurance. [s49]
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital would help you get medical treatment.  You should let the study doctor know right away that you are ill or injured.  If you believe you have become ill or injured from this research, you should contact Dr. __ at telephone number ___. You should also let any health care provider who treats you know that you are in a research study. 
If you get ill or injured as the direct result of being in this study, then, depending on what insurance you may have, the sponsor may pay for some or all of the costs for your medical treatment of the illness or injury if  it:
(a) is not a medical condition that you had before you started the study;
(b) is not the result of the natural progress of your disease or condition;
(c) is not caused by your failure to follow the study plan; and  
(d) is not proved to be directly caused by the negligence of an Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. 
If your case meets all four of these requirements and you are uninsured or have Medicare or Medicaid, then the sponsor will pay all of the costs of your medical treatment for the illness or injury.
If your case meets all four of these requirements and you have private insurance, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will look at the claims for these costs to see if they can be sent to your insurer for payment.  Your insurer may be told that you are in a research study and given information about your treatment.  
You will have to pay for any costs that the sponsor or your insurer does not pay. The sponsor will pay for any of the costs that are not paid by your insurance provider. The sponsor will not pay for costs like co-payments that your insurer says you have to pay. 
Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital have not set aside any money to pay you or to pay for your treatment if you get ill or injured from being in the study.  The only exception to this policy is if it is proved that your injury or illness is directly caused by the negligence of Emory or St. Joseph’s Hospital employee.
Costs[slk50]
OPTION 1: There are no costs, research or standard of care related, associated with the study.[slk51]

There will be no costs to you for participating in this study, other than basic expenses like transportation. You will not be charged for any of the research activities.

OPTION 2: The sponsor will pay for certain items or services associated with the study.[slk52]
The study sponsor will pay for certain items and services that you may receive if you take part in this study.  

You will have to pay for the items or services for which the study sponsor does not pay. The sponsor will not pay for your regular medical care. If you have insurance, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will submit claims to your insurance for items and services that the sponsor does not cover.  Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will send in only those claims for items and services that it reasonably believes your insurance will pay and that the sponsor has not paid. 
       
The actual amount that you have to pay depends on whether or not you have health insurance and whether or not that insurance will pay for any research study costs. Generally, insurance companies will not pay for items and services that are required just for a research study. Some insurance companies will not pay for regular medical treatment or treatment for complications if you are in a study.  How much you will have to pay for any co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance depends on your plan.  Emory, St. Joseph’s Hospital, and the sponsor will not pay for these costs. 
       
It is a good idea to contact your insurance provider and tell them you want to be in this research study.  Ask them what they will pay for and what they will not pay for.  You can also ask the study team for help in figuring out what you will have to pay. 

If you do not have insurance, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will review your case as part of their programs for low-income patient care.  The standard policies of that program will apply.  The program will figure out if you have to pay any costs for taking part in the study and what those costs will be.
       
OPTION 3: The sponsor will not pay for any items or services associated with the study.[slk53]
The study sponsor does not plan to pay for any items or services that you may receive if you take part in this study.    
       
You will have to pay for the items or services that are part of this study. The sponsor will not pay for your regular medical care. If you have insurance, Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will submit claims to your insurance for items and services that are part of this study.  Emory and St. Joseph’s Hospital will send in only those claims for items and services that it reasonably believes your insurance will pay and that the sponsor has not paid. 
       
The actual amount that you have to pay depends on whether or not you have health insurance and whether or not that insurance will pay for any research study costs. Generally, insurance companies will not pay for items and services that are required just for a research study.
