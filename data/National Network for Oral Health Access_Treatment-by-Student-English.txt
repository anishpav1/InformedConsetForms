Consent for Treatment by a Student
The Community Health Centers, Inc. (CHCI) Dental Clinic is participating in the
training of dental students, dental hygiene students and dental assisting students.
This program provides students with a variety of clinical experiences unique to a
community health center setting. Students are well along in their training with
some that have already completed all clinical requirements for graduation.
The licensed staff at the CHCI dental serve as clinical instructors and will be
supervising the student and your case in order to assure the best possible treatment.
This interchange provides valuable feedback for he student, staff members and
yourself as the patient. Should you wish to ask any questions about your care or the
program, please feel free to do so at any time.
We thank you in advance for participating in the program and enabling us to
provide this valuable educational experience. Because of your cooperation, the
people of Colorado can expect premiere health care.
I have read, understand, and give my consent to be treated by a student while in the
dental clinic of the Community Health Center, Inc.
