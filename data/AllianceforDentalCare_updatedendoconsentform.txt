I have been made aware of my condition listed above on tooth #_____________requiring endodontic (root canal)
treatment in the opinion of my dentist. I am aware that the practice of dentistry is not an exact science, and no
guarantees have been made to me concerning the results of the procedure.
I understand that an alternative treatment might be (but not limited to) extraction of the involved tooth or teeth.
I understand that the consequences of doing nothing might be worsening of the condition, further infection, cystic
formation, swelling, pain, loss of tooth, and/or other systemic disease problems.
Some complications of root canal treatment may be, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•

Failure of the procedure necessitating re-treatment, root surgery, or extraction
Post-operative pain, swelling, bruising, and/or restricted jaw opening that may persist for several
days or longer
Breakage of an instrument inside the canal during treatment, which may be left as is, or may require
surgery by a specialist for removal
Perforation of the canal with instruments which may require additional surgical treatment by a
specialist or result in the loss of the tooth
Damage to sinuses or nerves resulting in temporary or possibly permanent numbness or tingling of
lip, chin, tongue, or other areas.

Successful completion of the root canal procedure does not prevent future decay or fracture. An endodontically
treated tooth will become more brittle and may discolor. In most cases a full crown is recommended after treatment
to lessen the chances of fracture. The endodontically treated tooth may also need a post and build-up prior to being
crowned. Posts, build-ups, crowns, crown lengthening surgery, or any other restorative treatment is not included in
the fee for endodontic treatment.
I understand the recommended treatment, the risks of such treatment, any alternatives and the risks of these
alternatives including the consequences of doing nothing. Fee(s) involved have also been explained to me, and I
have had a chance to have all of my questions answered.
