Before you sign this form, be sure you understand what the study is about, including the risks and possible benefits to you.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THE RESEARCHERS

1.1 Study title:

Page 1 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





The study title must match on all documents (application, protocol, consent document, etc.). If applicable, add a local identifier code after the title (e.g., MCRU #### or UMCCC ####). NOTE: The footer of the informed consent document template includes spaces for the investigator to designate the subtitle and version of each consent document used in the study. The "Consent Subtitle" uniquely identifies a consent document when a study uses multiple consents (e.g., Main, Genetic, Screening, Treatment Group, etc.). Lengthy subtitles may need to be abbreviated to fit into the footer space. When a study uses only a single consent document, this item in the footer may be deleted. The "Consent Version" MUST be completed, and is utilized as a document tracking system. The version designation can take the form of a date or alphanumeric code, and is created and used by the investigator to distinguish this consent document version from previous versions and/or future revisions of the document (e.g., 06/01/2003, 1.1, 1.2, 1a, 1b, etc.). Each consent document revision, whether administrative or substantive, should trigger a change to this code.

1.2 Company or agency sponsoring the study:

Provide the name(s) of the sponsor(s) of the study. If the study is not sponsored, state or otherwise explain that there is no sponsor.

1.3 Names, degrees, and affiliations of the researchers conducting the study: List the names and degrees of the PI and Co‐Is and their respective affiliations (i.e., Department and Institution). For example: "Ima Researcher, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan".





2. PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY


2.1 Study purpose:

Briefly, in one paragraph, explain in lay‐terms the scientific reason for doing this study. Do not describe the details of the protocol here – that will be done in Section 4 "Study Procedures". For example: “Disease Z is known to be caused by increased levels of a particular protein, called Y, in the bloodstream. Research in animals has shown that a new drug, called X, can lower the levels of the Y protein. We do not know, however, whether Drug X is safe for use in humans, and if so whether it will lower levels of Y protein in people as well as it has in animals. This research study is being done to learn what effect 3 months of treatment with Drug X will have on the levels of Protein Y in the bloodstream of patients with Disease Z."

3. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPANTS (SUBJECTS)

Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. You may also leave the study at any time. If you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

If applicable, investigators should consider using this section to reassure subjects that their standard medical treatment does not depend on their participation in this study.

3.1 Who can take part in this study?

List important eligibility criteria in lay‐terms. Also include a discussion of important exclusion criteria, if applicable. For some studies, investigators may wish to remind potential subjects of the importance of providing complete and accurate information about their health condition/history in order to ensure that they are safe and appropriate candidates for participation.

3.2 How many people (subjects) are expected to take part in this study?

Insert the total number of subjects you expect to enroll. If this is a multi‐site study, include the total number over all sites as well as the number at UM. For example: "300 subjects are expected to participate, 25 at the University of Michigan and 275 at other sites around the United States." If the study includes different subject pools (control group/affected group), note that also. For example: "100 total subjects (25 subjects with Alzheimer’s disease and 75

healthy subjects)".

4. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPATION

4.1 What will happen to me in this study?

Page 2 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





Explain in lay terms, usually in chronological order, what will happen to subjects during the study. If appropriate, describe medical care or other procedures that would be performed whether or not the subject participated in the study. In this case, be sure to distinguish the research‐only or experimental procedures from routine or regular care.

ALL research‐only/experimental procedures and treatments must be listed in this section, including any clinical tests or procedures that may have to be repeated in order to conform to the study protocol (e.g., repeat CT scan that was done 6 months ago because protocol requires CT scan within last 4 weeks). The following should always be addressed, as applicable:

 Eligibility Testing (e.g., blood tests, CT scan, office visit, EKG, etc.),

 Experimental intervention/interaction (e.g., study drug or device, experimental neuropsychological test, etc.)

 Data collection (e.g., blood samples, CT scan, office visit, EKG, survey, etc.)

 Other research procedures or activities

Be sure to describe:

 Any wash‐out periods or other deviations from the subjects' regular regimen.

 If research‐only tests will not be analyzed or assessed in a timely manner for clinical care purposes.



Genetic Testing ‐ For research studies that include genetic sub‐studies to collect genetic information about a subject, the subject must “opt in” to that aspect of the study. You may still allow a subject who decides not to take part in the genetic aspect of the study to take part in the main study.



Explain in lay terms the following information:

 How long and where the specimen and resulting genetic information will be stored

 Whether the subject can withdraw the specimen and any resulting genetic information from the research study

 Whether the subject will be told the results of any genetic testing

 Who exercises control over the specimen and whether the specimen will be shared, and with whom

 Whether the subject, PI/study team, or the University of Michigan will obtain any financial benefits from the research

 Whether there are any risks to participating in the research as well as efforts to minimize the risk, such as the GINA statute

The researcher must obtain a separate signature from the subject for this portion of study. See Section 12 for more information.

Recommended language for blinded studies:



Introductory sentence (modifiable to reflect study design):



For some research studies, such as the one you are being asked to join, it is important that certain test results are not seen by you. Whether you intend it or not, sometimes learning this information may make you change your actions and behaviors in ways that could impact the outcome of the study.



Secondary sentences (Not modifiable FOR BLINDED STUDIES that would be compromised by subjects viewing results in the patient portal – standard to be used):



For this study, you will not be able to see your research test results. In order to keep you from seeing those results, you are agreeing to have a temporary, limited access placed on the Patient Portal in MyUofMHealth.org.

If you agree to this limited access, you won’t be able to see any laboratory test results (for example, result of a cholesterol test or glucose test) and you won’t be able to see radiology test results (for example, results of x rays, MRIs, or CT scans). While you are on this study, you will still be able to see and use other parts of the Patient Portal in MyUofMHealth.org to refill prescriptions, set up appointments with your doctor, or pay your medical bills on‐line, etc. When this study is over with, full access to the Patient Portal in MyUofMHealth.org will be returned to you.

4.2 How much of my time will be needed to take part in this study?

Explain as needed, describing time in hours, number of visits, amount of time each visit will entail, etc. Include expectations for long‐term follow‐up visits, if applicable. For example: "Each subject will receive Drug X for 6 months, then have at least 3 follow‐up visits to the researcher over the next 6 months. Each visit is expected to last about 1

hour." Be liberal in your estimations of time!

4.3 When will my participation in the study be over?

Explain as needed the overall amount of time, including on‐going examination of medical or other records, if applicable.

For example: "In addition to the time above, we will collect information from your medical records for another 3 years after your participation. Most subjects will complete their part in the study within about 4 years. The entire study is expected to last about 5 years."

5. INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS AND BENEFITS

5.1 What risks will I face by taking part in the study? What will the researchers do to protect me against these risks?

Page 4 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





Explain the risks and discomforts in clear, simple, concise terms (consider using bulleted format). Please note that

"none" or "not applicable" are not considered appropriate for this section, since even studies involving minimal risks do have foreseeable risks, such as discomfort or inconvenience, or risk to confidentiality.

Note that federal regulations require that research consent documents list ALL reasonably foreseeable risks, stresses, and discomforts of ALL aspects of participation in a study, not just the most serious or common side effects of a research intervention or procedure (e.g., study drug or device). Avoid statements like "The main risks are…" or "Side effects include…" as these statements would not comply with the federal requirement to list all foreseeable risks.

However, investigators are encouraged to stratify the risks by categories such as

 "The most common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) are:"

 "Less common side effects (1% ‐ 10% of patients) are:"

 "Rare side effects (less than 1% of patients) are:"

Remember to include the risks of any research‐related monitoring procedures such as biopsies, blood draws, or radiological tests, as well as the risks of allergic reactions and adverse drug‐drug interactions, as applicable. Include risks to a fetus if women of child‐bearing potential may participate in the study. It is not necessary to list risks associated with non‐research procedures.

The known or expected risks are:

The researchers will try to minimize these risks by:

When appropriate, also note here that in order to minimize risk, those procedures already being performed on subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes will be used for the research. List the procedures these include. This list can be general or specific, as appropriate. For example: "To avoid extra blood tests we will use the results of blood tests you are having for your clinical care."

Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) – If the research involves genetic analysis of biological samples, insert the following two paragraphs:



The federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.

This law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long‐term care insurance. Under this law:

 Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we obtain from this research

 Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums

 Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we obtain from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment GINA does not apply to the following groups, however these groups have policies in place that provide similar protections against discrimination:

 Members of the US Military receiving care through Tricare

 Veterans receiving care through the Veteran’s Administration (VA)

 The Indian Health Service

 Federal employees receiving care through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plans As with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected.

5.2 What happens if I get hurt, become sick, or have other problems as a result of this research?

For Internally Funded or Investigator‐Initiated (Non‐Sponsored) Projects Study teams should direct questions to your designated CRAO analyst for guidance on completing section 5.2 and/or section 8.1 of the informed consent with regard to injury language and potential business risk.

Consent Version: ________________________





Delete the following sentence if the statement does not apply to this study.

The researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. Even so, you may still have problems or side effects, even when the researchers are careful to avoid them. Please tell the researchers listed in Section 10 about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you have during this study. You should also tell your regular doctors.

Explain how risks are monitored and reduced. For example, explain that the subject will receive a physical examination and blood test once a week after beginning treatment with the new drug or device. Also explain what steps will be taken if complications or adverse effects are detected (e.g., "first aid will be provided" or "the drug dose will be lowered or stopped altogether"). Information about payment for first aid or emergency care should be provided in Section 8

"Financial Information" and not here in Section 5 "Risks and Benefits."

5.3 If I take part in this study, can I also participate in other studies?

Being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the risks to you.

It may also affect the results of the studies. You should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers involved in each study.

If applicable, include a description of any relevant potential risks associated with participation in multiple studies (e.g., drug interactions, excessive radiation exposure, etc.).

5.4 How could I benefit if I take part in this study? How could others benefit?

You may not receive any personal benefits from being in this study.

This should always be the first sentence. If applicable, it can be followed with language that describes possible benefits to subjects or to society. For example: “However, some subjects may [describe potential benefit to subjects]” and/or

“Possible benefits of the research for society (or for future patients with this disease) include [describe potential benefit to society]”. Do not describe payments or other compensations to subjects here. That information belongs in Section 8

on "Financial Information" (below).

5.5 Will the researchers tell me if they learn of new information that could change my willingness to stay in this study?

If new information might affect the eligibility of subjects to continue to participate in the study, address that possibility here and also in answer to Question 7.3. For studies in which a subject's participation is limited to a single experimental session (e.g., a single survey study, or study that collects all data at a single time point), investigators may choose to delete this question from the template.

Yes, the researchers will tell you if they learn of important new information that may change your willingness to stay in this study. If new information is provided to you after you have joined the study, it is possible that you may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information.





6. OTHER OPTIONS


6.1 If I decide not to take part in this study, what other options do I have?

Page 6 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





Describe alternatives to participation in the research study, including what is usually done to treat the condition or disease. Be sure to include information, when appropriate, about all alternative treatments that may be of benefit.



Examples of alternatives may include, but are not limited to: treatment or intervention utilized outside of the research context (e.g., clinical care on‐label or off‐label use), over‐the counter (OTC) medications, and additional research studies (e.g., www.clinicaltrials.gov). All alternative treatment options suggested to research subjects should warn that use of alternatives should be undertaken with appropriate continued medical supervision.



Possible language includes:



There may be other ways of treating your condition. These include: [list alternative treatments and/or interventions, as well as how they may be available (standard treatment, different study, over‐the‐counter)].

Although [investigational product] is available as part of this clinical study, you should check with the researcher and/or your primary care physician to discuss your options including how to obtain any alternative treatments and whether they must be obtained through a physician or require medical supervision.



For non‐therapeutic studies, in which there is no “alternative” or standard treatment, reiterate the voluntary nature of participation and state that the alternative is to not participate.





7. ENDING THE STUDY


7.1 If I want to stop participating in the study, what should I do?

If applicable, investigators should consider using this section to reassure subjects that their standard medical treatment does not depend on their continued participation in this study. If the study involves special procedures for termination of treatment (e.g., orderly withdrawal from drug treatment) or potential dangers of terminating treatment (e.g., on implanted device studies), investigators should edit the boilerplate text under Question 7.1 as appropriate, and be sure to describe the termination risks and procedures under Question 7.2. Please note that subjects always have the right to end their participation in research for any reason, so be careful not to imply that subjects should remain in the study against their will or should stop participating only for certain reasons.

You are free to leave the study at any time. If you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you. You will not lose any benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. If you choose to tell the researchers why you are leaving the study, your reasons for leaving may be kept as part of the study record. If you decide to leave the study before it is finished, please tell one of the persons listed in Section 10 “Contact Information”

(below).

7.2 Could there be any harm to me if I decide to leave the study before it is finished?

Let the subject know about any termination procedures that might exist for this study (e.g., exit interviews, tests, etc.), and any dangers of terminating treatment abruptly or completely, particularly without consulting with the researchers or another doctor, etc.

7.3 Could the researchers take me out of the study even if I want to continue to participate?

Yes. There are many reasons why the researchers may need to end your participation in the study. Some examples are:

 The researcher believes that it is not in your best interest to stay in the study.

 You become ineligible to participate.

 Your condition changes and you need treatment that is not allowed while you are taking part in the study.

 You do not follow instructions from the researchers.

 The study is suspended or canceled.





8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION


8.1 Who will pay for the costs of the study? Will I or my health plan be billed for any costs of the study?

Page 7 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





If there is no cost for the study, delete all of the language under 8.1 EXCEPT FOR THE LAST PARAGRAPH and state “There are no costs or billing for this study.”

The study will pay for research‐related items or services that are provided only because you are in the study. If you are not sure what these are, see Section 4.1 above or ask the researchers for a list. If you get a bill you think is wrong, call the researchers’ number listed in section 10.1.

“The study will pay for” means the internal or external sponsor. The discussion in section 4 will have made clear what items or services are research‐related. The final approved billing plan may serve as a good list to provide to subjects.

Note: Change the text in this paragraph if study‐related items or services are NOT paid for by the study (e.g., “the study does not pay for the cost of the drug or device.”)



Some sponsors may require the following language:

If you are treated for a research injury that is paid for by the study sponsor, then the study sponsor may need to collect certain information about you, such as your name, date of birth, and Medicare Health Insurance Claim Number, or if you do not have one, your Social Security Number. This information will be used only to check to see if you receive Medicare, and, if you do, to report the payment made by the study sponsor to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS,” which administers the Medicare program. The study sponsor will not use this information for any other purpose.

By signing this form, you specifically authorize the study sponsor to disclose your personal identifiable information to CMS for the purpose of complying with these Medicare reporting requirements.

If any complication, injury, or illness requiring medical treatment is paid for by the external INDUSTRY sponsor, the STUDY TEAM MUST INSERT THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE: “The study team has given you instructions about this research study. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully. If you get sick, have a medical complication, or are injured as a result of your being in the study, call Dr. [XXX] immediately, at [XXX‐XXX‐XXXX]. The doctor will either treat you or send you to another doctor for treatment. You will get free medical care for any complication, injury, or illness caused by the study drug, device, or procedure. The study sponsor and the study doctor are responsible for determining whether your condition was the result of your participation in the study. The study sponsor will pay for your treatment only if the need for treatment has been caused by the study drug, device or procedure. This means that you or your health plan must pay for any treatment that is part of your usual medical care or that is related to a medical condition you had before participating in the study."

For Internally Funded or Investigator‐Initiated (Non‐Sponsored) Projects Study teams should direct questions to your designated CRAO analyst for guidance on completing section 5.2 and/or section 8.1 of the informed consent with regard to injury language and potential business risk.

If any complication, injury, or illness requiring medical treatments is paid for by a GOVERNMENT (Federal) sponsor, the STUDY TEAM MUST INSERT THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE: "The study team has given you instructions about this research study. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully. If you get sick, have a medical complication, or are injured as a result of your being in the study, call Dr. [XXX] immediately, at [XXX‐XXX‐XXXX]. The doctor will either treat you or send you to another doctor for treatment. You will get free medical care at the UMHS for any complication, injury, or illness caused by the study drug, device, or procedure. The UMHS and the study doctor are responsible for determining whether your condition was the result of your participation in the study. The UMHS will pay for your treatment only if the need for treatment has been caused by the study drug, device or procedure. This means that you or your health plan must pay for any treatment that is part of your usual medical care or that is related to a medical condition you had before participating in the study. It is not the general policy of the federal funding agencies to compensate or provide medical treatment for human subjects in federally funded studies."

You or your health plan will pay for all the things you would have paid for even if you were not in the study, like:

 Health care given during the study as part of your regular care

 Items or services needed to give you study drugs or devices

Page 8 of 19

Consent Subtitle: ________________________

Consent Version: ________________________





 Monitoring for side effects or other problems

 Deductibles or co‐pays for these items or services.

If you do not have a health plan, or if you think your health plan may not cover these costs during the study, please talk to the researchers listed in Section 10 below or call your health plan’s medical reviewer.

If appropriate, identify any specific known or expected insurance coverage problems for this study, and modify the boilerplate at “…if you think your health plan may not cover…” to provide additional important information. For example, research subjects participating in certain Phase I trials may jeopardize their insurance coverage for the

"standard" or "routine" care of their disease or condition. The billing specialist in your department may be able to help you determine if this is applicable to this study.

There is no need to identify in the consent form every single item or service that might be provided in connection with the study, the cost of the item or service, and who will be responsible for payment. However, the subject should be provided with contact information for a person who can provide that information in case it is relevant to the subject’s decision (likely the study coordinator or other identified administrator). Make sure there is no promise for the UM to pay if insurance does not. Reference any sponsor promise to pay (e.g., sponsor will pay for items or services if insurance does not; or sponsor will pay for costs associated with complications that sponsor determines are sponsor’s responsibility). Contact the Calendar Review & Analysis Office (CRAO) if you have any questions.



By signing this form, you do not give up your right to seek payment if you are harmed as a result of being in this study.

DO NOT DELETE the last paragraph: "By signing this form, you do not give up your right to seek payment if you are harmed as a result of being in this study.”

8.2 Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?

Provide clear, concise information. For example: “No. You will not be paid for taking part in this study.” or “You will receive $20 for completing the study questionnaire.” Include the amounts and conditions of payment. Investigators are advised that payments to subjects should be prorated, and the amount earned to date should be paid even when subjects withdraw from the study prematurely. Incentive payments for completing the study, or disproportionately high levels of payments, might constitute enticement and should not be offered.



8.3 Who could profit or financially benefit from the study results?

Delete any of the sub‐headings under this question that are not applicable to this study.

If no person or organization has a financial interest in the outcome of the study, so state in answer to this question and delete all sub‐headings.

If a person or organization involved in the conduct of this study may have a conflict of interest, consider addressing under this question any of the following issues that may apply:

 How is the research supported or financed?

 Where and by whom was the study designed (i.e., industry‐sponsored versus investigator‐initiated)?

 Do individuals or the institution receive any compensation that is affected by the study outcome?

 Do individuals or the institution

(1) have any proprietary interests in the product (including patents and licensing agreements); (2) have an equity interest in the sponsor;

(3) receive significant payments of other sorts (e.g., grants or consultant retainers); and/or (4) receive payment per participant or incentive payments?

If this study does not involve Protected Health Information (PHI) (e.g., medical or billing records) and is not subject to the HIPAA privacy rule, investigators may choose to delete “…AND AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE PROTECTED HEALTH

INFORMATION" from this section heading.

The information below describes how your privacy and the confidentiality of your research records will be protected in this study.

9.1 How will the researchers protect my privacy?

Describe procedures that will be followed to keep subject information, specimens, and tissues secure and confidential.

For example: “Your research information will be stored in a locked cabinet and will not be made a part of your regular medical record. However, if the researcher orders any tests, the order and results may become part of your regular medical record." Or: “Research records will be kept in a separate research file that does not include names, registration numbers, or other information that is likely to allow someone other than the researchers to link the information to you.” This would be the place to mention a Certificate of Confidentiality, if applicable. Please check the IRBMED

website for additional information on Certificates of Confidentiality if your study involves use or disclosure of extremely sensitive information (e.g., illegal drug use).

9.2 What information about me could be seen by the researchers or by other people? Why? Who might see it?

Signing this form gives the researchers your permission to obtain, use, and share information about you for this study, and is required in order for you to take part in the study. Information about you may be obtained from any hospital, doctor, and other health care provider involved in your care, including:

 Hospital/doctor's office records, including test results (X‐rays, blood tests, urine tests, etc.)

 Mental health care records (except psychotherapy notes not kept with your medical records) If psychotherapy notes that are not part of the regular medical record will be used or disclosed for the study, separate permission is required from the subject. Investigators are advised to contact the Health System Legal Office for guidance.

 Alcohol/substance abuse treatment records

 Your AIDS/HIV status

 All records relating to your condition, the treatment you have received, and your response to the treatment

Specify the "condition" or disease (e.g., arthritis, cancer, etc.)

 Billing information

There are many reasons why information about you may be used or seen by the researchers or others during or after this study. Examples include:

This paragraph should apply to all studies and should not be deleted. Delete or add examples in the bullets below as appropriate for this study unless the instructions specifically prohibit deletion. For example, delete the bullet about reporting subject payments if subjects do not receive payment for participation. Do NOT delete the bullet about University and Government officials.

 The researchers may need the information to make sure you can take part in the study.

 The researchers may need the information to check your test results or look for side effects.

 University, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and/or other government officials may need the information to make sure that the study is done in a safe and proper manner.

DO NOT DELETE this bullet.

 Study sponsors or funders, or safety monitors or committees, may need the information to: o Make sure the study is done safely and properly

o Learn more about side effects

o Analyze the results of the study

 Insurance companies or other organizations may need the information in order to pay your medical bills or other costs of your participation in the study.

 The researchers may need to use the information to create a databank of information about your condition or its treatment.

Do not delete this bullet unless you are certain that the data or specimens will not be used for:

 future IRB‐approved research studies

 a tech transfer or licensing agreement.

Contact Office of Technology Transfer if you are uncertain.

 Information about your study participation may be included in your regular UMHS medical record.

If you don’t use this bullet, make sure you can reliably keep the information out of the medical record.

 If you receive any payments for taking part in this study, the University of Michigan accounting department may need your name, address, social security number, payment amount, and related information for tax reporting purposes.

Child Abuse ‐ Michigan law requires the reporting of actual or suspected child abuse or neglect by certain persons

(called mandated reporters). Mandated reporters include physicians, nurses, therapists, and other medical

professionals. A complete list may be found here.



The following language should be inserted if actual or suspected child abuse may be revealed during this study:



 For the parental permission form: If you tell us or we learn something that makes us believe that your child or



others have been or may be physically harmed, we may be required to report that information to the



appropriate agencies.



 For the child assent form: If you tell us or we learn something that makes us believe that you or others have



been or may be physically harmed, we may be required to report that information to the appropriate agencies.



A study team may consist entirely of mandated reporters, a combination of mandated and non‐mandated reporters, or

entirely of non‐mandated reporters. The above language accommodates each of these scenarios.



If you encounter actual or suspected child abuse or neglect, contact the UHMS Child Protection Team for assistance: 734.763.0215 or http://www.med.umich.edu/mott/cpt/





 Federal or State law may require the study team to give information to government agencies. For example, to prevent harm to you or others, or for public health reasons.



The results of this study could be published in an article, but would not include any information that would let others know who you are.

Alternate language for use when identifying information will be used in publications or presentations: "The results of this study may be published or presented at a scientific meeting. If your name or other information that might identify you will be used in the publications or presentations, the researchers will ask for your separate written permission."

Likewise, if video or audio recordings or photographs of the subject will be used: "If your name and pictures will be used in any publications or presentations, the researchers will ask for your separate written permission."

ClinicalTrials.Gov ‐ “Applicable clinical trials” are required by federal law to be registered in www.ClinicalTrials.gov.

Please read this guidance: http://msa.med.umich.edu/regulatory_affairs/research/human/clinicaltrials#IRB%20Approval (Level 2 password required). Applicable trials must also use the standard template language below, unaltered.



If the study is NOT an “applicable clinical trial”, you may need or choose to register for other reasons, such as NIH

funding or ICMJE requirements. If you plan to register your study, replace the statement below with the following: This trial may be registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a publicly available registry of clinical trials.



If the study is NOT an “applicable clinical trial”, and you do not plan to register it, you do not need to include any statement about www.ClinicalTrials.gov and should delete the statement below.



If you have questions or cannot access the guidance, contact the Medical School’s Office of Regulatory Affairs, or email UMMS‐RegAffairs@med.umich.edu.

A description of this clinical trial will be available on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by US law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at any time.

9.3 What happens to information about me after the study is over or if I cancel my permission?

Alternate language for non‐PHI/HIPAA‐regulated studies: "…leave the study before it is finished…"

As a rule, the researchers will not continue to use or disclose information about you, but will keep it secure until it is destroyed. Sometimes, it may be necessary for information about you to continue to be used or disclosed, even after you have canceled your permission or the study is over.

Alternate language for non‐PHI/HIPAA‐regulated studies: "…even after you have left the study…"

Examples of reasons for this include:

 To avoid losing study results that have already included your information

 To provide limited information for research, education, or other activities (This information would not include your name, social security number, or anything else that could let others know who you are.)

 To help University and government officials make sure that the study was conducted properly As long as your information is kept within the University of Michigan Health System, it is protected by the Health System’s privacy policies. For more information about these policies, ask for a copy of the University of Michigan

“Notice of Privacy Practices”. This information is also available on the web at http://www.uofmhealth.org/patient+and+visitor+guide/hipaa. Note that once your information has been shared with others as described under Question 9.2, it may no longer be protected by the privacy regulations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

If the study does not involve PHI and is not subject to HIPAA, and this statement does not otherwise apply, investigators should edit or delete this paragraph accordingly.

9.4 When does my permission expire?

Your permission expires at the end of the study, unless you cancel it sooner. You may cancel your permission at any time by writing to the researchers listed in Section 10 "Contact Information" (below).

Alternate language, if applicable: "Your permission will not expire unless you cancel it.”

11. RECORD OF INFORMATION PROVIDED


11.1 What documents will be given to me?

Your signature in the next section means that you have received copies of all of the following documents:

 This "Consent to be Part of a Research Study" document. ( Note: In addition to the copy you receive, copies of this document will be stored in a separate confidential research file and may be entered into your regular University of Michigan medical record.)

A copy of the complete (every page) signed consent form should be placed in the UM medical record of subjects, particularly when the research intervention may affect other treatment or care. However, doing so may not be appropriate in all cases (for example if identification of the subject as a study participant might put the subject at risk of criminal prosecution or harm to reputation). If that is the case, replace "…and may…" with "…but will not…" If more appropriate for this study, the portion of the sentence after "…separate research file…" may be deleted altogether.

Two‐Parent Signature Requirement ‐ If the study involves minor subjects and the permission of one parent is sufficient or if the study involves adults unable to consent and requires the permission of one legally authorized representative, the Second Parent Permission box below should be deleted.



If the study involves minor subjects with no prospect of direct benefit to the minor subject and the risks are assessed by the IRBMED to be greater than minimal, the consent of both parents (or of the legal guardian) is required.



Research that holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely to the fetus requires the permission of both parents unless the father is unavailable, incompetent, or temporarily incapacitated, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.



When the second parent’s permission is not documented, indicate the reason (see the end of the Second Parent Permission box).
