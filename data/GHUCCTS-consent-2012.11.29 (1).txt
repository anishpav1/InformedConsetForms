The purpose of this study is to _____________________. 

[Choose applicable text:]

Observational Studies:	Learn about the natural history of (name of disease) and its causes and treatments.

Phase I Studies: 	Test the safety of (drug/intervention) and see what effects (good and bad) it has in your (patient's condition).
Or
Find the highest dose of (drug) that can be given without causing severe side effects.

Phase 2 Studies:	Find out what effects (good and bad) (drug/intervention) has on you and your (patient's condition).

WHY IS THE STUDY BEING DONE?

Pharmacogenomic research studies genetic differences among people and how those differences may affect a response to a specific drug or medicine. That may include genetic differences in how people absorb and metabolize drugs. It also may include genetic differences in the targets within cancer cells that a drug is trying to effect.

Cells in the human body contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All genes in every cell are composed of DNA. The genes contain key instructions for cell function, and overall help determine the characteristics of each individual person. DNA is the map for how each cell will carry out the instructions. DNA is not 100% identical from person to person.  There are changes that occur within a gene when a single building block (nucleotide) in the DNA sequence is altered.  These alterations are called SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms. Additional genetic variations between people can come from there being more or fewer copies of a gene, or part of a gene. Although more than 99% of human DNA sequences are the same for all people across the population, these small changes in the DNA sequence can have a major impact on how people respond to medicines. In this study we are trying to determine how genetic variations may help explain differences in how people respond to, and experience toxicities from, the medicines we use to treat cancer patients.

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?

Participants in the study are referred to as subjects.

About ____ subjects will take part in this study worldwide; ______ subjects will be recruited at this site.

WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?

[Provide simplified schema and/or calendar.]

[For randomized studies:]

You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups: (describe the groups). Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance.  It is like flipping a coin. Which group you are put in is done by a computer.  Neither you nor the researchers will choose what group you will be in. You will have an (equal/one in three/etc.) chance of being placed in any group. (If blinded) Neither you nor the investigator will know what group you are in.

You will be given a study medication and it will either contain (name of drug) or placebo (pills with no medicine)

[For nonrandomized and randomized studies:]

If you take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures:

[List procedures and their frequency under the categories below. For randomized studies, list the study groups and under each describe categories of procedures.  Include whether a patient will be at home, in the hospital, or in an outpatient setting.  If objectives include a comparison of interventions, list all procedures, even those considered standard.]

Procedures that are part of regular care and may be done even if you do not join the study.

Standard procedures being done because you are in this study.

Procedures that are being tested in this study. 

Please advise the researchers of any medications you are taking.  In addition, if you are taking any over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements which you have obtained from the drug store, grocery store, etc., you should advise the researchers.

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?

We think you will be in the study for (months/weeks, until a certain event).

[Where appropriate, state that the study will involve long-term follow-up.]

The researcher may decide to take you off this study if ____________________.

[List circumstances, such as in the participant's medical best interest, funding is stopped, drug supply is insufficient, patient's condition worsens, new information becomes available.]

You can stop participating at any time.  However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to talk to the researcher and your regular doctor first.

[Describe any serious consequences of sudden withdrawal from the study.]

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?

Risks and side effects related to the (procedures, drugs, or devices) we are studying include:

[List by regimen the physical and nonphysical risks of participating in the study in categories of "very likely" and "less likely but serious."  Nonphysical risks may include such things as the inability to work.  Highlight or otherwise identify side effects that may be irreversible or long-term or life threatening.]

[For Chemotherapy studies, please include the following phrase when appropriate.]

Although very rare, it is possible that treatment-related side effects could result in death.

[Observational studies - describe risks and discomfort of procedures and questionnaire.]

There may also be side effects, other than those listed that we cannot predict. Other drugs will be given to make side effects that occur less serious and less uncomfortable. Many side effects go away shortly after the (drug /intervention) is stopped, but in some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting or permanent.
For more information about risks and side effects contact the investigator at__________.

[Reference and attach drug sheets, pharmaceutical information for the public, or other material on risks.]

[For Pharmacogenomic studies, please replace the section above with:]

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?

Avoidance of Pregnancy: The medicines and procedures used in this study may be unsafe for an unborn baby, an infant, sperm, and eggs. If you, as a subject of study, are a woman of child bearing potential, you must agree to avoid pregnancy during your participation in this study and for three months after the completion of the study (include when appropriate); if you, as a subject, are a man, you must agree to not conceive a child during your participation in this study and for three months after the completion of the study (include when appropriate).
If you do become pregnant during the study or if you father a child during the study, you should immediately notify Dr. __________________ at 202-______________. In addition, if you are already pregnant or are breast feeding, you cannot participate in this study.

If your study involved drugs that are known to be teratorgenic, please contact the GHUCCTS IRB administrator for specific language to be added. 

[Fill in the blanks.]

Risks associated with participating in genetic testing.

Risks of participating in research involving genetic testing include the use of personal, genetic information for unauthorized or discriminatory purposes. All research personnel who will have access to genetic information about you are ethically and legally obligated to maintain the confidence of that information. However, there can be no absolute guarantees that the genetic information will remain confidential. 

A new federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  This law generally offers the following protections:

* Health insurance companies and employer-based group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. 

* Health insurance companies and employer-based group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.

* Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we get from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.

All health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this law by May 21, 2010.  All employers with 15 or more employees must follow this law as of November 21, 2009.  The protections offered by GINA apply regardless of when the research that obtained the genetic information was conducted, even if prior to the effective date.  

Be aware that this new law does not protect you against discrimination on the basis of your genetic information by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  

[If research involves determining whether subjects have an already manifest genetic disease or disorder, add language indicating that GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.]

In addition, there is a risk that being in a genetics study can cause psychological distress or tension with other family members. 

ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

[If possible benefits are expected, use:] If you agree to take part in this study, there may or may not be direct medical benefit to you.

[If no possible benefits are expected, use:] If you agree to take part in this study, there will be no direct medical benefit to you.

We cannot promise that you will experience medical benefits from participating in this study.  We hope the information learned from this study will benefit others in the future.

[For Pharmacogenomic studies, please replace the section above with:]

ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

There will not be any direct medical benefit to you if you are to participate in this study. We hope the information learned from this study will benefit others in the future.

It is possible that, in studying data from you and others, researchers may discover information that would be potentially relevant to your future health. In the event that this occurs, there are no plans to make this information available to you, since the blood and tissue samples may have been coded in a way that makes it difficult to trace the result back to a specific person, and since the results of scientific research of this type are often based on group data, and therefore represent a general risk, but not a specific diagnosis of risk for an individual.

WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE?

Whether you participate in this study or not, you will receive care to manage your symptoms and keep you comfortable. Instead of being in this study, you have these options:

[List alternatives including commonly used therapy(ies)]

WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?

Efforts will be made to protect your medical records and other personal information to the extent allowed by law. However, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.
