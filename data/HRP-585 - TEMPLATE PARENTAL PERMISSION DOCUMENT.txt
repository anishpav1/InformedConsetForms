What is research?            	
Doctors and researchers are committed to your child's care and safety. There are important differences between research and treatment plans:
* The goal of research is to learn new things in order to help groups of people in the future. Researchers learn things by following the same plan with a number of participants, so they do not usually make changes to the plan for individual research participants. You, as an individual, may or may not be helped by volunteering for a research study.
* The goal of treatment is to help you get better or to improve your quality of life. Doctors can make changes to your treatment plan as needed. 
Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?
We are asking you and your child to take part in this research study because you are the parent of a child [describe the inclusion criteria].

[Include this statement for a clinical trial or other research that involves randomization. Otherwise delete.] The treatment your child gets will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the study doctor will choose what treatment your child will get. You will have a(n) __________________ [equal / one in three /etc.] chance of being given either treatment.
[For double-blinded research add] Neither you nor the study doctor will know which treatment your child is getting.
[For single blinded research add] You will not be told which treatment your child is getting, however your study doctor will know.
What happens if I do not want to be in this research?
You and your child may decline to participate and it will not be held against you. [Include if there are alternatives other than participating. Otherwise delete.] Instead of being in this research study, your choices may include: [List alternatives procedures. For clinical trials, describe the options that you would normally offer a patient.

 If you decide to leave the research, contact the investigator so that the investigator can [Describe the procedures for orderly termination by the participant, if any.]
 
Choosing not to be in this study or to stop being in this study will not result in any penalty to you or loss of benefit to which you are entitled. Meaning, your choice not to be in this study will not negatively affect your child's right to any present or future medical treatment. 

At any time, you or your child may decide to withdraw from the study. If you withdraw, no more information will be collected from you or your child. When you indicate that you wish to withdraw, the information already collected from you and your child will be used in the study because they will not be able to remove it from the information they have gathered. [If applicable, otherwise remove.] The investigator may ask to continue to collect information from your child's routine medical care, such as your child's medical records.
What are the risks? Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me or my child?
[Describe each of the following risks, if appropriate. If known, describe the probability and magnitude of the risk to the child.  The risks of procedures may be presented in a table form.]
●  	Physical risks
● reproductive risks
●  	Psychological risks
●  	Privacy risks
●  	Legal risks
●  	Social risks
●  	Economic risks

Also, in general, do not include results of animal studies, unless there is no other known risk information and inclusion would aid with understanding.]
 
This research may hurt your child in the following ways: ________________.
[Include for research that involves procedures whose risk profile is not well known, including all research involving an investigational product. Otherwise delete.] In addition to these risks, this research may hurt you in ways that are unknown. These may be a minor inconvenience or may be so severe as to cause death.
What happens to the information collected for the research?
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of you and your child's personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. The video recorded conversation is for data analysis purposes only. It will not be used in any presentations or publications.  

[Describe any plans for the information collected, including general information about data storage and sharing of information outside of the study team including funding agencies or sponsors.]

We will not ask about child abuse, but if your child tells us about child abuse or neglect, we are legally obligated to report it to state authorities.  
Will anyone besides the study team be at the consent meeting?  
You may be asked by the study team for your permission for an auditor to observe the consent meeting (or a recording of the consent meeting). Observing the consent meeting is one way that the University of Minnesota makes sure that the rights of research participants are protected. The auditor is there to observe the consent meeting, which will be carried out by the people on the study team. The auditor will not record any personal (e.g. name, date of birth) or confidential information about you or your child. The auditor will not observe the consent meeting (or a recording of the consent meeting) without your permission ahead of time.   

Will I have a chance to provide feedback after the study is over? 
After the study, you might be asked to complete a survey about your child's experience as a research participant. You do not have to complete the survey if you do not want to. If you do choose to complete the survey, your responses will be anonymous.  
If you are not asked to complete a survey after the study is over, but you would like to share feedback, please contact the study team or the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP). See the "Who Can I Talk To?" section of this form for study team and HRPP contact information.
What else do I need to know?
[Revise to align with the protocol.] You or your child will be paid [amount] for their participation in this study. We will also reimburse you [amount] (if taking public transportation) or a free parking pass (if driving) to cover the costs of your transportation. All payments will be given directly to you.  
If for any reason you and your child do not complete the whole study, you will still receive the full payment and travel reimbursement.  
[Note: include this paragraph if the study is taking place in a school:

Parents please be aware that under the Protection of Pupils Right Act 20 U.S.C. Section 1232 (c)(1)(A), you have the right to review a copy of the questions asked of or materials that will be used with your students. If you would like to do so, you should contact <Name of PI> to obtain a copy of the questions or materials.]
