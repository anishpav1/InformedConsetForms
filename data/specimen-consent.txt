	CONSENT TO DONATE SPECIMENS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Study Title: [Insert study title here]
[Add SIMPLIFIED TITLE if needed for subjects' comprehension]

This is a request that you donate specimens for medical research. The researchers, ...,[M.D.,] and ..., [Ph.D.,] from the [UCSF Department of . . .], will explain this research to you.

Medical research includes only people who choose to take part.  Take your time to make your decision about participating.  You may discuss your decision with your family and friends and with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you may ask the researchers.

You are being asked to take part in this study because you are/have  [specify prospective subjects' medical condition or other reason for recruitment to study, such as being about to have specific tissue removed, some of which will not be needed for clinical care].

Why is this research being done?

The purpose of this study is to...[Limit explanation to why study is being done, explaining in one or two sentences.  See examples for drug/intervention trials directly below.

[Address sponsorship and financial interests here:

* The IRB requires that all consent forms disclose which agencies or institutions (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Center for Disease Control, State agencies), cooperative groups (CALGB, COG, ACTG), foundations or industry sponsors are funding the research or providing study drugs or equipment for the study. If the study is not being funded by an external agency, then the internal funding source, i.e., Department funds, personal funds, should be identified.
 
* Investigators must also disclose the nature of any financial or proprietary interests, though this disclosure can be in general terms. For suggested wording, see Conflicts of Interest in Research.


How many people will take part in this research?

About [state total accrual goal here] people will be asked to donate specimens for this research.  [For multi-center studies, it is good to give figures both for the whole study and for local enrollment at UCSF.]

What will happen if I agree to donate my specimens?

If you agree to let researchers collect and store your specimens for future research, the following will happen:
* After all routine tests required for your care are finished, instead of discarding your leftover specimens we will save them in what is called a "tissue bank" for possible future research.. We also will collect and save information from your medical record, including things like [List all types of information to be recorded for study purposes, including results of physical examinations, diagnostic tests, medical questionnaires and histories, diagnoses, treatments, etc. Be complete; this listing is required by HIPAA regulations.] We do not know for sure if your specimens or medical record will be used, but they might be used in research about [List the types of conditions that the specimens may be used for research on, e.g. cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other diseases.]  Genetic information taken from the specimens (also known as genotype data) and the medical record data (also known as phenotype data) may be shared broadly in coded form.
* [If any additional tissue (including blood) will be taken for research purposes, describe the procedures, including how the sample will be taken and how much will be taken. For example: We will also collect a sliver of normal muscle or skin (the size of a grain of rice) from the same place we make a cut for your surgery. We will draw extra blood (2 tablespoons) through tubes already in place for your surgery. We will not collect the extra muscle and blood if we think it will cause any additional risk, discomfort, or pain beyond what we normally expect from your surgery.]
* [If the researchers will continue to gather additional information from medical records or other sources over a period of time, the collection activities and amount of time they will continue should be described here.]
* We may give your specimens and certain medical information about you (for example, diagnosis, blood pressure, age if less than 85) to other scientists or companies not at UCSF, including to a (public or controlled access) government health research database, but we will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that would identify you. Reports about any research will not be given to you or your doctor.
* Sometimes specimens are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if we use the specimen for genetic research, we will not put the results in your medical record. The research will not change the care you receive. Your specimen and any information about you will be kept until it is used up or destroyed. It may be used to develop new drugs, tests, treatments or products. In some instances these may have potential commercial value. Your personal health information cannot be used for additional research without additional approval from either you or a review committee. 

* Your specimens will be kept for [State how long specimens will remain in the repository. If they will become part of a permanent collection, they will be kept indefinitely]. If you decide later that you do not want your specimens and information to be used for future research, you can notify the investigator in writing at [insert address], and we will destroy any remaining identifiable specimens and information if they are no longer needed for your care. However, if any research has already been done using portions of your specimens, the data will be kept and analyzed as part of those research studies.

What risks are involved with donating specimens for research?

Describe any risks of any additional sampling. For example: Any extra tissue or blood we take from you will come through cuts or tubes needed for your surgery, and should not cause you any risk, discomfort, or pain beyond what we normally expect from your surgery.]
Confidentiality: Donating specimens may involve a loss of privacy, but information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible. Study data will be physically and electronically secured.  As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security.  Your name will not be used in any published reports from research performed using your specimen. The manager of tissue bank [insert name] and select tissue bank staff members will have access to information about you but they will not release any identifying information about you to researchers using your specimen. The UCSF Institutional Review Board and other University of California personnel also may see information about you to check on the tissue bank. 
Genetic information that results from this study does not have medical or treatment importance at this time.  However, there is a risk that information about taking part in a genetic study may influence insurance companies and/or employers regarding your health. To further safeguard your privacy, genetic information obtained in this study will not be placed in your medical record.
Taking part in a genetic study may also have a negative impact or unintended consequences on family or other relationships.  If you do not share information about taking part in this study, you will reduce this risk.  Although your name will not be with the sample, it will have other facts about you such as [insert specific details].  These facts are important because they will help us learn if the factors that cause [insert specific condition] to occur or get worse are the same or different based on these facts.  Thus it is possible that study finding could one day help people of the same race, ethnicity, or sex as you.  However, it is also possible through these kinds of studies that genetic traits might come to be associated with your group.  In some cases, this could reinforce harmful stereotypes.

[Include the following section only if extra blood or other tissue will be removed or there are other biomedical procedures performed on the subjects for research purposes.]
What happens if I am injured because I took part in this study?
It is important that you tell your study doctor, __________________ [investigator's name(s)], if you feel that you have been injured because of taking part in this study.  You can tell the doctor in person or call him/her at __________________ [telephone number].
Treatment and Compensation for Injury:  If you are injured as a result of being in this study, the University of California will provide necessary medical treatment.  The costs of the treatment may be billed to you or your insurer just like any other medical costs, or covered by the University of California or the study sponsor [sponsor name], depending on a number of factors.  The University and the study sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury.  For further information about this, you may call the office of the Institutional Review Board at 415- 476-1814.  [NOTE: This statement must be used without changes. See the IRB website for standard wording for the SFVAMC and for other comments].
What are the benefits of donating specimens for research?

There will be no direct benefit to you from allowing your specimens to be kept and used for future research. However, we hope we will learn something that will contribute to the advancement of science and understanding of health and disease.

What financial issues should I consider before donating?
You will not be charged for donating your specimens. You will not be paid for donating your specimens. If the data or any new products, tests or discoveries that result from this research have potential commercial value, you will not share in any financial benefits. UCSF may receive payment from researchers requesting specimens in order to cover the costs of collecting and storing the specimens.
What alternatives do I have? 

If you choose not to donate your specimens, any leftover blood and/or tissue removed during your surgery that is not needed for diagnosis will be thrown away [and no additional normal tissue or blood will be removed for research purposes].

What are my rights if I take part in this study?
Taking part in this study is your choice.  You may choose either to take part or not to take part in the study.  No matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you and you will not lose any of your regular benefits.  Leaving the study will not affect your medical care.  You can still get your medical care from our institution. 
In the case of injury resulting from this study, you do not lose any of your legal rights to seek payment by signing this form.
Who can answer my questions about the study?
You can talk with the study researcher about any questions, concerns or complaints you have about this study.  Contact the study researcher(s) __________________ [name(s)] at __________________ [telephone number(s)].
