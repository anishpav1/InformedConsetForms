How to use this template:
This document was developed to assist study teams in creating consent forms for studies that pose physical risks to subjects, including treatment studies and studies involving physical interventions.  
● Instructions are highlighted in grey. 
● IRB-recommended language is in black type and should be used when possible. Sections with black headings must be included in the consent form.
● Sections with blue headings should be used when relevant and deleted if they do not apply to your study.
● Blue text should be edited or deleted as necessary to fit the specifics of your study.
● See the Additional Language document for model language to use in specific situations.  
● Links connect to relevant guidance documents.

Before submitting a consent document for IRB review:
● Delete this cover page and all instructions.  
● Make all text black.
● Use the Preview Final Documents tool in ARROW to check formatting. 

NOTE for VA research: If the research study involves VA patients (including records and specimens), is VA-funded, or the research is conducted by personnel under their VA time, use the VA consent form template.  Much of the model language included in the UW-Madison Health Sciences IRBs consent form template can be used in VA consent forms as well.
