Introduction
You are being asked to take part in a research study about genetic testing related to a person’s 
response to drugs.  
 This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will 
do if you choose to be in this study, and the way we would like to use information about 
you and your health.  
 You are asked to be in this study because you get your healthcare from a General Internal 
Medicine doctor at Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation.  You may also be taking 
certain medications (clopidogrel, warfarin, or simvastatin) right now or possibly in the 
future.  These medications are used for preventing strokes, blood clots, and heart 
diseases.  They have FDA recommendations about genetic testing before prescribing.   
We will use information from your electronic medical record, such as your age and 
medical history, to predict if you may be prescribed one of these medications in the 
future.  
Why are we doing this study?
We want to learn more about genetic differences (or variations) that can be involved in a 
person’s response to drugs.  We also want to learn how doctors and patients understand and use 
results from genetic tests that determines a person’s response to a medication.   Genetic testing is 
usually a blood test.  Your blood will be sent to a laboratory to look at genetic differences in your 
DNA that are associated with changes in how drugs work in your body. Genes are the biological 
instructions for your body and are made up of DNA. Genes (and DNA) are passed down from 
parents to their children. The study of how genetic differences affect a person’s response to drugs 
is called pharmacogenetics.   More information about this study can be found in the 
accompanying pamphlet.  To accomplish this study, we are doing two things: 
1. You will be tested for a few of the genetic changes that are known to be related to how a 
person responds to certain medications.  The results from this test will be put in your 
medical record with the goal of having your doctor use the results in your health care.  
You will learn of your results either by a letter, through your MyChart account, and/or 
from your physician.  Physicians have also agreed to be a part of this study.  Both you 
and your physician will be asked about their experiences with these results to help us 
learn how patients and doctors understand and use results from these types of genetic 
tests.

2. You will also donate a blood sample to help researchers learn more about other genetic 
changes that may be important to a person’s response to drugs. Additional testing will be 
performed on this sample, and unlike the testing above, results from these tests will be 
shared with other researchers and most likely not be returned to you.  No identifying 
information about you will be shared with outside researchers. However, as we improve 
our knowledge about genes that affect response to drugs, we may decide to share the 
additional knowledge about these drugs with you and your doctor. You will have the 
option to receive results from this additional testing if they become available during the 
study period (now through 2015). 
What will you do if you choose to be in this study? 
A study coordinator will meet with you at the Northwestern General Internal Medicine Clinic 
around the time of your regular doctor’s appointment.  If you prefer, a separate time and location 
can be arranged.  The first visit will be approximately 30-40 minutes long.  
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following things:
1. Complete 4 surveys during this study.  You will complete the first one at our face-to-face 
meeting after you sign this form.  The other 3 surveys will be mailed or emailed to you at 
approximately 1, 6 and 12 months after you receive the pharmacogenetics test results.  
Each survey should take about 20-30 min to complete and will ask about your 
expectations and experiences with pharmacogenetics testing.
2. Give about 1 tablespoon (20mls) of blood for genetic testing.  
3. Let us put results of your genetic testing such as information related to clopidogrel, 
warfarin and simvastatin into your electronic medical record and follow how that 
information is used.
4. Let us store your genetic information from the additional genetic testing in a secure 
research database for future studies related to genes and drug responses.  
5. You will be encouraged to sign up for MyChart, if you have not already done so. You 
will not be required to sign up for MyChart to be in this study.
6. Tell us at the end of this form if you would like to be contacted about results from any 
additional testing that might be performed. 
7. You will receive your pharmacogenomic test results approximately 3 months after giving your 
blood sample.  You will then receive your first follow-up survey 1 month after receiving your 
results and your final survey 12 months later. This would conclude your participation.
What are some of the possible risks and discomforts?
 The risks of a blood draw may include pain, a bruise at the point where the blood is 
taken, redness and/or swelling of the vein and infection.
 There is the potential risk for genetic discrimination.  Having the genetic test results in 
your medical record may increase the risk to your privacy.   Your insurance company 
may have access to this information, just like they would any other information that is in 
your medical record.  The federal Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) 
of 2008 protects you from discrimination by health insurance companies and employers 
(http://www.genome.gov/10002077), and we are careful to protect your privacy.

However, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be used in an unintended 
way.  
 Learning about your genetic risks may cause you anxiety and other psychological 
distress.  
 As with any research study, there is the possibility for breach of confidentiality and loss 
of privacy.
What are the possible benefits for you?
 You may not benefit from genetic testing from this study.
 Information from this study may help your doctor make choices about drug options for 
you.  It may also help avoid bad side effects.  
 Taking part in this study may help scientists to better understand the role of genes in the 
way a person responds to certain medications. 
What other procedures or courses of treatment might be available to you?   
 You do not have to take part in this research study.  Clinical genetic tests for the 
medications included in this study are available.  You may choose to pursue testing on 
your own.  If you choose to not participate in this study or do any pharmacogenetic 
testing, your doctor will make choices for medications based on the current standards of 
care.
Are there any financial costs to being in this study?
 No, you will not be charged for any costs related to the study.  This includes the blood 
draw and the genetic tests.  If you wish to speak to a genetic counselor, you may speak to 
a genetic counselor involved in the study for free.
 The cost of your regular medical care will be billed to you or to your insurance company 
in the usual way. Any follow-up procedures related to your genetic results that your 
doctor recommends will be considered part of your regular medical care, and will not be 
paid for by the research study.  
Will you receive payment for participation in this study?    
 No, you will not be paid for your participation in this project.  
 Allowing for the storage and future testing of your tissue and blood samples will involve 
no cost to you. Your sample will be used only for research and will not be sold. The 
research done with your tissue and blood sample may lead to the development of new 
products in the future. No compensation will be given to you now or in the future for the 
use of these samples

Certificate of Confidentiality
The principal investigator has a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government.  A 
Certificate of Confidentiality helps protect the privacy of human research participants enrolled in 
studies that collect sensitive information.  Certificates protect against legal demands, such as 
court orders and subpoenas, for information that could identify you in this study.   
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United 
States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of Federally funded projects or for 
information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of 
your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this 
research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research 
information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.
