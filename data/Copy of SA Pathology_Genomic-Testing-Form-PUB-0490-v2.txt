(name) consent to

genetic testing for 	

(name of condition)

Clinical indication(s) 	

 Whole Exome

or

 Whole Genome

or

 Clinical Exome (please tick)

I understand that:

•

Genetic testing requires a sample: blood/saliva or tissue,
from which DNA will be isolated.
The laboratory will not analyse genetic changes not known
to be associated with the condition(s) above.
Current methods may not be able to find all genetic
changes associated with the condition(s). Not finding
a genetic change does not necessarily rule out the
condition(s).
There is a small chance that the test will not work properly
or an error will occur.
Test results may reveal unexpected health risks and/or
information on parentage.
Test results may have implications for children and/or
other family members.
Results from these tests may affect my ability to obtain
some types of insurance.

Genetic test results will be reported only through a doctor
or genetic counsellor.
Results are confidential and will only be released to family
members or authorities with consent or as allowed by law.
Genetic test results are based on best evidence at the time
of reporting. SA Pathology does not undertake to perform
additional analysis of my genetic data after the report is
issued.
Sample(s), including extracted DNA, will be kept for the
period required by laboratory guidelines.
Through a treating doctor, this request may be cancelled or
changed before a report is issued.
With consent (below), sample(s), test results and other
relevant information may be used for research studies that
have been approved by an Institutional Ethics Committee.
Results will not be affected by this choice.

Results are reported as:

	
	

•	
•	
•	

A genetic change associated with the condition was detected.
Analysis did not detect any genetic change known to be associated with the condition.
Genetic changes of unknown significance were found*.

*A genetic change is classified as of unknown significance if there is not enough data at this time to allow interpretation. The significance of the result could 	
change in the future as more information becomes available. Genetic changes of unknown significance will only be reported if requested.
