ASSENT FORM 
What is Assent? 
Assent is the process of obtaining authorization to collect a specimen from individuals who are not able 
to give consent for themselves. Legally authorized representatives must provide consent for children 
and cognitively impaired subjects to donate a sample, but the investigator/submitter must attempt to 
obtain assent from the subject if it is possible. Children aged 7 through 17 can give authorizations by 
signing this assent document.  This form is to be used in addition to the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell 
Repository Informed Consent Form (Form 1401-63). 
What is the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository? 
The NIGMS Repository is a biobank. A biobank is a collection of samples from peopleâ€™s bodies that are 
stored in a safe place. Cells from people with inherited diseases are stored in the NIGMS Repository. We 
are trying to help researchers find out about the causes of diseases that run in families. Scientists want 
to find the causes of disease so they can help doctors to cure the disease or even stop it from happening 
in the first place. 
What will happen if I participate? 
If you want to donate a sample, this is what will happen. We will take a small amount of blood from your 
arm or a small piece of skin from the inside of your arm. This sample will be used to make more samples 
that can be given to the scientists to study. 
There are some parts of the study that might hurt or upset you when the blood or skin is taken, but we 
will make it as comfortable as possible for you. You might feel a pinching or burning for a few minutes or 
there may be a little bleeding that needs a BandAid. 
Do I have to participate? 
You can decide yourself if you want to donate a sample. We do not know if donating a sample will help 
you, but someday we may learn something that will help other people.  You do not have to donate a 
sample. It is up to you. You will still be taken care of even if you decide that you do not want to be in the 
study. 
If you want to donate a sample, please sign or print your name.
