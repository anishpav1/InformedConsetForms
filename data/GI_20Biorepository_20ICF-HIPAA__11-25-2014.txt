CONSENT TO BE A RESEARCH SUBJECT

Title of Study: MUSC GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE BIORESPOSITORY



A. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

The purpose of this study is to create a storage bank to be used in future research to learn more about preventing, diagnosis and treating disease. You are being asked to donate your human biological material (tissue, blood and cells from the inside of your cheek) because you have a gastrointestinal (GI) disease, are a family member of someone with GI disease or are a healthy volunteer without GI disease. The investigator in charge of this study is Don C. Rockey, M.D. This study is being done at MUSC and will involve approximately 5,000 volunteers.



B. PROCEDURES

If you decide to take part, the following will happen:

Screening: After enrollment into the study, research personnel will collect and review information from your medical record. The research personnel may also ask you

questions about your medical history.



Information Collection: An investigator will conduct a brief question and answer session to obtain basic information about you and your background. This data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of GI disease) and family history of GI, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.



Medical Record: If you are a GI patient, we will review your medical records for information about your history and treatment that will make your donated samples more useful to the research community. This data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of GI disease) and family history of GI, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Investigators may use your health information for future research on various diseases. However, your personally identifiable information will never be released to researchers outside the Medical University of South Carolina. All of your information will be stored on a password protected database on a password protected network drive. All samples will be in a secure biological material bank.



Study Procedures - as a participant, you will undergo the following procedures: Collection of your material:



Blood sample: If you are a GI patient and scheduled to have blood drawn as part of your routine medical care, then we will obtain an additional blood draw of up to 35ml (Approximately 7 teaspoons). If you do not have a blood draw as part of your routine medical care, we will setup a separate appointment.





IRB Number: Pro00027522

Date Approved 8/18/2015

Expiration Date: 8/17/2016





If you are a family member or healthy volunteer, up to 25ml (5 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn from you through a needle in your arm.



Buccal swab for tissue cells: We also use a small brush to rub the inside of your cheek in order to obtain tissue cells for genetic analysis.



Tissue sample: If you are a GI patient and have a standard of care medical procedure that removes tissue, we will collect some of the tissue left over after tissue needed to make clinical decisions has been obtained.



For all samples collected:

• Donated samples will be assigned a unique code and transported to the MUSC

Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository. Only research personnel will have access to the samples within the MUSC Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository and these

samples will be stored with the unique code that links the samples to you. Research staff will collect medical information at the time of initial biospecimen collection and also review your chart at regular intervals in order to obtain follow-up information.



• Samples and associated data collected under this protocol will be de-identified and released to other researchers, per requests accompanied by the necessary IRB

approvals and documentation for their research study.



• Donated Samples will be stored indefinitely and information may continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn consent. If you withdraw consent, it must be requested in writing. The unused samples will be destroyed and no

additional data will be collected or made available for future research. However, samples and data already being used for research prior to the date of the request will continue to be used for the IRB approved research study.



• MUSC SCTR Biorepository: In addition to the MUSC GI Disease Biorepository, a small left over portion of DNA samples will be donated to the MUSC SCTR

Biorepository and made available for other physicians for their research purposes with IRB approval. The samples that are donated to the MUSC SCTR Biorepository

will also use a unique code on the labels that will allow us to link your sample back to you.

C. DURATION



Samples are collected as a one-time visit when you are at the hospital. Your samples and clinical data will be stored indefinitely and information may be continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn your MUSC Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository consent. Medical records will be reviewed once a year for five years.



D. BIOSPECIMEN STORAGE

This specimen storage bank works in such a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. Your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen labels and containers. The information about your identity will be replaced with a coded number that will allow us to trace your sample back to you.

All other medical information, such as your name, diseases, age, gender, and ethnic group will be stored separately from your materials in a password protected secure database.



When you give permission for this material to be stored and used for research, you are also giving permission for researchers to review your medical record for information about your health and to study this material with this information. Your material will not be used for research unless the research study is reviewed and approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board for Human Research.



This material might be given to researchers outside of the Medical University of South Carolina for research projects. If this is done, your name will not be released with the material; a code will be attached so other researchers will not know the material belongs to you.

E. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS

There are risks to taking part in this research study. One risk is the loss of confidentiality; however we have taken steps to minimize this risk by using unique codes instead of your name or other patient identifiers on biospecimen labels.



Risks and side effects related to the collection of your material include:



• The risks of blood drawing include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection or clot in the vein. Fainting could occur.



• The risks of obtaining a buccal swab may include slight pressure against the cheek when obtaining the sample.



Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. You have been given this consent form because the Medical University of South Carolina investigators want to include your tissue, cell or blood sample in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues, cells or blood to be studied or to be stored.



• Your tissue, cell or blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier which could be linked to you. Sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. If this is done, the other investigators would not know your name.



• In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood, cells or tissue sample. For instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood, cells or tissue samples. Such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.



• Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. It is not generally the University’s policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. However, certain studies, called "pedigree studies", share such information among family members. For this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members.



• You have the right to refuse to allow your blood, cells or tissue samples to be studied or saved for future research studies. You may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. This means that while the University might retain the identified samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for research.

• South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. Our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any member of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. Our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the Institutional Review Board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. You will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. The Medical University of South Carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing.



• Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. Some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. Some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. The risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. The risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. But these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. If there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. A process called "genetic counseling" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions.



Investigators in this study may try to recontact you in the future to find out about your health.

If you are recontacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the Investigators or your health team might tell you:



A. Information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project.

B. You carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated.

C. You can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. This news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease.

D. You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. It can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. Genetic counselors can help sort out the various

options in such a case.



Also, for any future research, we may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information.



If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. This would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. You should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor.

The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. Informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. On the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. Genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors.



These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There might be other risks we do not know about yet. It is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study.



For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers or study staff.



F. BENEFITS

There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. We hope the information learned from this study will benefit other people with similar conditions in the future.



G. COSTS

There will be no cost to you for donating your samples. Expenses for routine health care for any medical problems will remain to be your responsibility (or the responsibility of your insurance provider or government program).



H. PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS

You will not be paid for participating in this study.



I. ALTERNATIVES



The alternative is to not participate. Participating in this project is voluntary.
