WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?A research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something that we don't know enough about.  Participating may not help you or others.  
People volunteer to be in a research study.  The decision about whether or not to take part is totally up to you*. You can also agree to give permission for your child to take part now and later change your mind. Whatever you decide is okay.  It will not affect your ability, or your child's ability, to get medical care at Mount Sinai.  
Someone will explain this research study to you. Feel free to ask all the questions you want before you decide.  Any new information that develops during this research study which might make you change your mind about your child's participating will be given to you promptly.
[For any study that will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, please add the following paragraph:]
Basic information about this study will appear on the website http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.  There are a few reasons for this:  the National Institutes of Health (NIH) encourages all researchers to post their research; some medical journals only accept articles if the research was posted on the website; and, for research studies the FDA calls "applicable clinical trials" a description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.
PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:The purpose of this study is......[Tell the subject the purpose of the research. Explain the background of the research problem IN LAY TERMINOLOGY. For example, explain to the subject the current therapies for the disease and why they are not satisfactory. For non-therapeutic studies, explain the scientific problem. Describe how this research will attempt to solve the problem.]

[Only if NO payment of any kind will be provided to subjects as part of their participation may this statement be removed:]  Tax law may require the Mount Sinai Finance Department to report the amount of payment received from Mount Sinai to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other agencies, as applicable.  Generally this reporting would take place if payments received equal $600 or more from Mount Sinai in a calendar year.  You would be responsible for the payment of any tax that may be due.
[If any reimbursement will be provided for expenses the subject will incur, such as transportation, indicate what evidence of the expenses the subject needs to provide (receipts).  Further guidance is available from the Finance Department.]
 [For studies involving prisoners, contact the IRB for advice] 
POSSIBLE BENEFITS:[If there are possible benefits to individual subjects from the research, add:] It is important to know that your child may not get any benefit from taking part in this research.  Others may not benefit either.  However, possible benefits may be ... .... [Describe the potential benefits of participation but do not overstate them. First describe any direct benefits to the subject, then any benefits to others. If benefits from participation may not continue after the research has ended, explain that here. For example, an investigational drug provided for free may not be available at the end of the research or may no longer be provided free if the drug becomes available for marketing. Monetary reimbursement for participation is not considered a benefit and should be described the Costs/Payments section.]
[If there are no expected benefits to individual subjects from the research, add:] Your child is not expected to get any benefit from taking part in this research study. Others may not benefit either. However, possible benefits to others include ... [Describe potential benefits to others but do not overstate them]

Where private information is being collected (most studies), include the following statement: There always exists the potential for loss of private information; however, there are procedures in place to minimize this risk.  
* Legal risks (for example, being reported for child abuse)
* Social risks (for example, damage to your social standing or reputation; possible discrimination)
* Economic risks (e.g. having to pay money out of pocket for research or medical expenses, loss of health insurance, missing work, being unable to obtain a job)]
[If the research involves the research use of genetic testing to diagnose the presence of a genetic variation linked to a predisposition to a genetic disease or disability in the subject or the subject's offspring, add the following: There is a Federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). In general, this law makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers of over 15 people to discriminate against your child based on genetic information. However, it does not protect you or your child against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.]
[Describe risks for each relevant procedure (for example, blood drawing, computerized tomography, survey, etc.) and for each drug, device or biologic that is being studied by the investigation.]
[Include relevant risks based on animal and in vitro studies, particularly for Phase I or II trials.]
[Describe the probability of risks (frequently, occasionally, or rarely expected).  For high-magnitude risks (ones that are life-altering or potentially life-altering, such as visual loss, anaphylaxis, paralysis, and aplastic anemia) explain the ramifications, even if these risks are rarely expected (for example, indicate what might happen to the subject if liver enzyme tests indicate an abnormality.]
[Describe risks to those other than the subject, along with corresponding instructions. For example, risk to a nursing infant if the mother is the research subject, risk to sexual partners or family members etc.]
[For research that involves known risks to an embryo or fetus, add and customize as appropriate:] This drug may harm a pregnancy or unborn child in the following ways: ... ..... Your child should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this research study. [Repeat birth control methodology here, as appropriate]
[If the research involves an investigational product or procedures whose risk profile is not well known, add:] In addition to these risks, this research may hurt your child in ways that are not known.  The unknown risks might be minor or might be major (death).
[If the research involves pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential and investigational products or procedures whose risk profile in pregnancy is not well-known, add, as appropriate:] If your child is or becomes pregnant, this research may hurt the baby or the pregnancy in ways that are unknown. The unknown risks might be minor or might be major (death). Your child should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this research study.  [Repeat birth control methodology here, as appropriate]  
OTHER POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO CONSIDER:You may decide not to permit your child to take part in this research study without any penalty.  The choice is totally up to you.
[If there are alternative procedures or courses of treatment that may be helpful to the subject, and if the treatments being studied are available outside of the research, add:] Instead of being in this research study, the choices may include: 
* [List alternative procedures. For clinical trials describe the options that you would normally offer a patient. If applicable, include supportive care as an option. Do not only state that "the study doctor will discuss options."]
[For clinical trials under FDA jurisdiction, and other studies if applicable, add:]  The important risks and possible benefits of these alternatives are listed below: 
* [Describe the important risks and potential benefits of each of the alternative procedures and courses of treatment.]
IN CASE OF INJURY DURING THIS RESEARCH STUDY:[Include one of the statements below based on an assessment of the total research risk level]
[For minimal risk protocols, add:] If you believe that your child has suffered an injury related to this research as a participant in this study, you should contact the Principal Investigator. 
[For protocols involving greater than minimal risk, add:]  If your child is injured or made sick from taking part in this research study, medical care will be provided. Generally, this medical care will be billed to you and/or your child's health care insurance in the ordinary manner and you will be responsible for all treatment costs not covered by your child's insurance, including deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance. This does not prevent you from seeking payment for injury related to malpractice or negligence. Contact the investigator for more information.
[Provide sponsor language regarding compensation for injury here, as applicable]
ENDING PARTICIPATION IN THE RESEARCH STUDY:You may decide to stop your child's participation in this research study at any time without any penalty. This will not affect your or your child's ability to receive medical care at Mount Sinai or to receive any benefits to which you, or your child, are otherwise entitled.
If you decide to stop your child's participation in the research study, please contact the Principal Investigator or the research staff.   [If procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject are necessary, describe them. For example, subjects on an investigational drug to treat their diabetes may be switched to an approved drug, subjects in a study of high dose corticosteroids may have their steroid doses tapered, etc.   Include any specific withdrawal procedures described in the protocol.  If applicable, add and customize: At that point...]  
[If there are possible adverse consequences to withdrawing from the research, add:] If you decide to stop your child's participation in the research study, the following may occur:... ... [Describe the adverse consequences that subjects may experience by unilaterally withdrawing from the research. For example, subjects on a drug to treat their diabetes may experience elevated blood sugars unless they switch to another drug. Subjects in an oncology trial who were getting benefit from the study drug may experience progression off the drug. Subjects in a study of high dose corticosteroids may experience life-threatening symptoms unless the steroid doses are tapered.]
[For clinical trials under FDA jurisdiction, add:] If you decide to stop your child's participation in the research study, already collected information may not be removed from the research study database and will continue to be used to complete the research analysis.  [Note: The consent document cannot give the option of having data removed.]  You may be asked whether the investigator can collect information from your child's routine medical care. If you agree, this data will be handled the same as research data.  [Note: If a subject is withdrawn from the interventional portion of a study and permission is not given to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access for purposes related to the study the subject's medical record or other confidential records requiring the parent/guardian permission. However, an investigator may review study data related to the subject collected prior to the subject's withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as those establishing survival status.]
[If samples are being banked from this research, describe if and how samples can be withdrawn or destroyed.]
[If the research involves a data or specimen registry, explain what withdrawal means, e.g. the sample will be returned, destroyed, anonymized, or no new information will be collected] 
You may also withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your child's protected information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your authorization, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use the information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the research study.  Your child's health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if your child should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from participating in the research study.
Withdrawal without your permission: The study doctor, the sponsor or the institution may stop your child's involvement in this research study at any time without your permission. This may be because the research study is being stopped, the instructions of the study team have not been followed, the investigator believes it is in your child's best interest, or for any other reason. If specimens or data have been stored as part of the research study, they too can be destroyed without your permission.  [If applicable add:] More possible reasons for removal from the study include... [add additional reasons why the subject may be withdrawn. Include all withdrawal criteria listed in the protocol. For example, if the protocol states that subjects will be removed from the research if they become pregnant, have tumor progression, or experience certain adverse events, list these here]
[If the research involves the research use of genetic testing to diagnose the presence of a genetic variation linked to a predisposition to a genetic disease or disability in the subject or the subject's offspring, include:
* A statement of the right to withdraw consent to use of the tissue for future use at any time and the name of the organization that should be contacted to withdraw consent
* A statement that indicates if consent to storage of the tissue sample is withdrawn at any time, the entity storing the sample will promptly destroy the sample or portions that have not already been used for research]
[NOTE: This information must not contradict the consent language for blood/tissue banking or database repositories that has been added for this study from the HIPAA page of the PPHS website.]

Why is your child's protected health information being used?
Your personal contact information, and that of your child, is important to be able to contact you during the study. Your child's health information and the results of any tests and procedures being collected as part of this research study will be used for the purpose of this study as explained earlier in this consent form. The results of this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, or other events, but would not include any information that would let others know who your child is, unless you give separate permission to do so.
[Include this statement if applicable, otherwise delete it:] The Principal Investigator may also use and share the results of these tests and procedures to treat your child. 
The research team and other authorized members of The Mount Sinai Hospital and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (together, "Mount Sinai") workforce may use and share your child's information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or accreditation requirements. For example, the School's Program for the Protection of Human Subjects is responsible for overseeing research on human subjects, and may need to see your child's information. If any payments for taking part in this study, the Mount Sinai Medical Center Finance Department may need names, addresses, social security numbers, payment amounts, and related information for tax reporting purposes.  If the research team uncovers abuse, neglect, or reportable diseases, this information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities. 
Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your child's protected health information?
As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai workforce may disclose your child's protected health information, including the results of the research study tests and procedures, to the following people or organizations: (It is possible that there may be changes to the list during this research study; you may request an up-to-date list at any time by contacting the Principal Investigator.)

- [For studies involving prisoners, contact the IRB for guidance] 
- Others: [name other groups who might receive the PHI, and why; examples may include foreign regulatory agencies, outside firms doing telephone polling, internet hosts, etc.]
[The following paragraph must be precise and customized to fit this study]  In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, your child will not be identified by [name, social security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier] unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law. Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to your child without your permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research organization, will come to inspect your child's records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the information leaving the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers.  Additionally, the monitors, auditors, the IRB, and the Food and Drug Administration will be granted direct access to your child's medical records for verification of the research procedures and data, if necessary. By signing this document you are authorizing this access. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your child's name and other identifying information confidential.
For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your child's protected health information? [A specific duration can be given, but has to be consistent with FDA, faculty handbook, and other guidelines. Otherwise, just insert this sentence:] Your authorization for use of your child's protected health information for this specific study does not expire.
Will you be able to access your child's records?
[Use this paragraph for blinded studies or other studies where access will be denied in order to protect the integrity of the research; otherwise delete it:]  During participation in this study, you will not be able to access your child's medical records. This will be done to prevent the knowledge of study results from affecting the reliability of the study. Your child's information will be available should an emergency arise that would require the treating physician to know this information to best treat your child. You will have access to your child's medical record and any study information that is part of that record when the study is over or earlier, if possible. The investigator is not required to release research information that is not part of your child's medical record to you.
[Use this paragraph for open label studies and other studies for which access will not be denied; otherwise, delete it:]  During participation in this study, you will have access to your child's medical record and any study information that is part of that record. The investigator is not required to release research information that is not part of your child's medical record to you.
Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share to you or your child health information?
NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your child's health information you should not sign this form, and your child will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study. If you do not sign, it will not affect treatment, payment or enrollment in any health plans or affect eligibility for benefits.
Can you change your mind?
You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your child's protected information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use your child's protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the study.  Your child's health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization should your child have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission to use your child's protected health information for research that means your child will also be withdrawn from the research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which your child is entitled will not be affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw your child from the research study at any time without canceling the Authorization to use your child's data.
[If subjects are not patients at The Mount Sinai Hospital and the information being gathered remains solely in the research record, the need to give out a Notice of Privacy Practices is eliminated and the following sentence can be removed (when in doubt, leave the sentence in, and give out the Notice of Privacy Practices to those who have not received it during the course of clinical care):]  If you have not already received it, you will also be given The Mount Sinai Hospital Notice of Privacy Practices that contains more information about how Mount Sinai uses and discloses protected health information.
It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount Sinai, the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy protection regulations. However, even if information will no longer be protected by federal regulations, where possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive the information to continue to protect confidentiality.
[If the research involves the research use of genetic testing to diagnose the presence of a genetic variation linked to a predisposition to a genetic disease or disability in the child or the child's offspring, the following information must be included. This information must not contradict the consent language for blood/tissue banking or database repositories that has been added for this study from the HIPAA page of the PPHS website:
* A statement that any further disclosure of genetic test results or information derived from genetic test to persons or organizations not named on the informed consent shall require the further permission from the parent/guardian.
* A statement that family members of an individual who provided a stored tissue sample will not be contacted for clinical, research, or other purposes without permission from the parent/guardian.]
If as part of this research project your child's medical records are being reviewed, or your child's medical history is being taken, it is possible that HIV-related information may be revealed to the researchers.  If that is the case, the following information concerns you.  If this research does not involve any review of medical records or questions about your child's medical history or conditions, then the following section may be ignored.

[For studies involving a Certificate of Confidentiality, insert the following paragraph (see COC policy for details); otherwise, delete it:]  Certificate of Confidentiality: To further protect privacy, the researchers have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Department of Health and Human Services. This Certificate does not mean that the Department of Health and Human Services approves of this research. Rather, it is intended to ensure that anything told to us will not have to be disclosed as a result from a subpoena for the purpose of identifying your child in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The research staff will not share any of your child's research information with anyone who is not a member of the research team, including any other family members or friends, other than to those identified above. You should know that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your child's involvement in this research. This means that you and your family must also actively protect your own privacy. If an insurer or employer learns about your child's research participation, and you agree that they can have your child's research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to keep this information from them. Finally, you should know that if we learn that your child, or someone else, is threatened with serious harm, the investigators may notify the appropriate authorities if necessary to protect your child or others.
