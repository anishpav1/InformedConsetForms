RESEARCH SUBJECT INFORMATION AND CONSENT FORM


Standard Headings - PLUS

SUB-INVESTIGATOR(S): UCI requires sub-investigators to be listed on the consent form

************************************************
Add the following text as the pre-amble to the consent form:
You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Participation is completely voluntary.  Please read the information below and ask questions about anything that you do not understand.  A researcher listed below will be available to answer your questions.

************************************************
PROCEDURES
WIRB approved study template or submitted text - plus

The site will include the number of study visits and how much time will be required of the subjects, per visit.  Also indicate how long subjects will be in the study.

************************************************
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:
WIRB approved study template or submitted text - plus


NOTE:  The following language MUST be submitted by the site if appropriate.

LIST ANY ADDITIONAL RISKS AS STIPULATED BY ANY OF THE FOLLOWING UCI REGULATORY COMMITTEES:
* Clinical Trials Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CTPRMC), required for all cancer trials
* Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) - see the required template language in the addendum at the end of this form
* Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)

The site will include if appropriate to the protocol when randomization is a study design element.
Randomization:  You will be assigned to a study group by chance (like a coin flip) rather than by a medical decision made by the researchers. The treatment you receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study group(s), or than standard treatments available for your condition.  

The site will include if appropriate to the protocol when the study design involves stopping drugs being used to treat a condition.
Washout period: During this study the medication you normally use for your condition will/may be stopped for up to [XX days/weeks/months]. You will/may receive no medication, or medication at a dose which may not help your condition. As a result, you will/may have an increase in symptoms including XX.

The site will include if appropriate to the protocol when the study design involves use of a placebo.
Placebo:  During this study there is a XX chance that you will receive a placebo. This could lengthen the amount of time before you receive a treatment that may be effective. During this time you may experience worsening of your condition, including increased symptoms such as XX. The researchers will carefully monitor your condition. If your symptoms worsen and make you uncomfortable, you can withdraw from the study.

The site will include if appropriate to the protocol when the study design involves testing for HIV, Hepatitis B or C.
Testing for Reportable Diseases:  This study requires testing for HIV and for Hepatitis B and C.  Being tested for these diseases may make you feel worried about the test results.  If you test positive for any of these diseases you will be told by the study doctor and you may not be eligible to participate in this study.  Receiving positive results may be difficult to accept.  Therefore, it is important that if you test positive you should see a health care provider as soon as possible. To the extent permitted by law, the researchers will keep your test results confidential and will not release them to anyone without your written permission.  California law does require that health care providers and clinical laboratories report positive test results with your personal identifying information to the local health department.

************************************************
Include when the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information
A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf

The appropriate language will be submitted by the site:

RADIATION RISK LANGUAGE AS DETERMINED BY UCI RSC:

[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is less than 1 rem].

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.  A [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA or CT scan] scan uses radiation to create pictures of the structures inside the body.  The total radiation dose that you will receive from [insert total number of scans] scan(s) of this type is about [insert total effective dose (e.g., 20 millirem)].  A millirem is a unit used to quantify radiation dose.  Typically persons in the U.S. receive a radiation dose of about 310 millirem per year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water and soils.  Therefore your total radiation dose will be about the same as [XX] extra [insert number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.    

There is no known health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure, and no radiation remains in the body after the scan.  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.  

[Insert if Gadolinium contrast used during CT or MRI scans]
Gadolinium contrast "dye" will be injected into your vein.  This increases the ability of the CT or MRI scan to show certain tissues in the brain or elsewhere in the body.  Side effects include a mild headache, nausea, or burning at the injection site. Some people are allergic to gadolinium, experiencing hives and itchy eyes, or very rarely, a bee-sting type of severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). Use of gadolinium may be linked to a rare but sometimes fatal condition (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis or NSF) in people with severe chronic kidney disease or acute kidney problems. Therefore, before you are given this dye your risk factors for kidney disease will be reviewed.

[Use language for a nuclear medicine scan if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is less than 1 rem.]

During this study you will have [insert number and type of scan; e.g., bone scan, thyroid scan, PET scan including body part to be imaged]  using a radioactive drug to produce an image of your [insert body part to be imaged].  The drug is injected [insert route of administration; e.g., it may be ingested] in your body, and then after [XX] hours [insert time based on specific nuclear medicine protocol], you will have a scan of your [insert actual body part; e.g., your whole body, thyroid, or heart] using a "gamma camera" that detects the radiation inside you, and creates a picture of structures inside your body.  This scan is solely for the purpose of this research, and you would not have this scan if you decide not to participate in this research study.  The total radiation dose you will receive from one scan is about 0.1 rem [put in actual total effective dose].  For comparison, persons in the United States receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem every year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water, and soils, so the radiation exposure from one scan is equivalent to about four extra months [put in actual number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.

After the scan, you will still have some radioactivity retained in the body, which will go completely away in the following [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan].  The risk to others is very low, but you may cause sensitive radiation detectors used for security to alarm in the [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan] after the scan.  There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  If you are especially concerned with radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the study doctor. 

[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is between 1 - 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.  A [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA or CT scan] scan uses radiation to create pictures of the structures inside the body.  The total radiation dose that you will receive from [insert total number of scans] scan(s) of this type is about [XX] rem [insert total effective dose (e.g., 2 rem)].  A rem is a unit used to quantify radiation dose.  Typically, persons in the U.S. receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem per year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water and soils. Therefore your total radiation dose will be about the same as [XX] extra [insert number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.

[Use language for a nuclear medicine scan if total dose to one individual (across entire study) is between 1 and 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [XX] [insert number and type of scan; e.g., bone scan, thyroid scan, PET scan including body part to be imaged]  using a radioactive drug to produce an image of your [insert body part to be imaged].  The drug is injected [insert route of administration; e.g., it may be ingested] in your body, and then after [XX] hours [insert time based on specific nuclear medicine protocol], you will have a scan of your [insert actual body part; e.g., your whole body, thyroid, or heart] using a "gamma camera" that detects the radiation inside you, and creates a picture of structures inside your body.

After the scan, you will still have some radioactivity retained in the body, which will go completely away in the following 24 - 48 hours [insert time based on isotope and scan].  The risk to others is very low, but you may cause sensitive radiation detectors used for security to alarm in the first [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan] after the scan.  There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  If you are especially concerned with radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the study doctor.
[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is greater than 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.

There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure, and no radiation remains in the body after the scan.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  The average adult in the United States has about a 42% lifetime risk of having cancer (that is, about 42 out of 100 people will have cancer in their life).  An exposure of [XX] rem [insert total effective dose], may increase that risk to about XX% [insert increased risk].  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.  

[Use language for a nuclear medicine scan if total dose to one individual (across entire study) is greater than 5 rem:

During this study you will have [XX] [insert number and type of scan; e.g., bone scan, thyroid scan, PET scan including body part to be imaged]  using a radioactive drug to produce an image of your [insert body part to be imaged].

There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  The average adult in the United States has about a 42% lifetime risk of having cancer (that is, about 42 out of 100 people will have cancer in their life).  An exposure of [XX] rem [insert total effective dose], may increase that risk to about XX% [insert increased risk].  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.
