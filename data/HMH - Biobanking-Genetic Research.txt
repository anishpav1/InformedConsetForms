Informed Consent]Authorization to Donate Tissue for Medical 
Research Sometimes tissue, blood, body fluids or cells are removed 
trom your body during surgery. For simplicity we are calling all these 
things 'tissue". Any removed tissue is used tor your care, diagnosis 
TMH469 
and treatment first, After all tests are done, tissue may be lett over. You may choose to 
donate it for medical research. No more tissue witl be removed than would normally be 
removed for your care. 
Before you decide to donate your tissue, read this information and talk to your doctor or 
nurse and make sure all your questions are answered. 
• You do not have to donate. 
• Your choice to donate or not will not affect your healthcare in any way. 
• If you change your mind after donating. we discard any unused tissue, 
What is the purpose of donating this tissue? 
• Human tissue research can help find new or better ways to diagnose, treat, cure and 
prevent disease. 
• Human tissue research may develop new commercial medical products. 
What will happen it you donate this tissue? 
• The tissue will be stored in a 'tissue bank' or repository for future use 
• The repository is controlled by a hospital committee called the Investigational Review 
Board or 'IRB.' 
• Researchers submit a plan to the IRB that explains how they will use the tissue and if 
they also want to use patients' health information. Their plan also describes how they will 
keep this information private 
• The hospital committee must approve the research plan before tissue or patients' health 
information is released to them. 
• These researchers will be primarily at Houston Methodist Hospital but the tissue or 
information from research on it may be shared with researchers from other universities 
and private companies, 
• At Houston Methodist Hospital your tissue wili on'y be used for research and will not be sold 
Will this tissue be used for qenetic research? 
This tissue could be used for genetic research or the study of genes. A gene is made from 
a long chain of molecules in cells called DNA The molecules are arranged in pairs. The 
order of the pairs is called "DNA sequencing" Every person has a unique combination of 
molecule pairs so it is called a genetic code. Researchers are trying to tind out if certain 
codes are linked to diseases. 
• Researchers may release the genetic code information to public databases on the 
Worldwide Web. 
• Only genetic code information will be released. Your name or personal information that 
could identify you will not be released. 
• Researchers and others can search these databases 
for codes that may be linked to certain diseases. 
• There is a very small chance that the genetic code could 
be traced to you. This is only possible if another 
specimen or information that was already linked to you 
could be compared to a" the information in the database

What are the possible benefits to you or to others? 
There will be no drect medical or personat benefit to you as a result of donating the tissue. 
The research may benefit other people in the future. 
What are the risks? 
• There are no medical risks to you. 
• Genetic studies may have results that are unique and individual to you and there is a 
small possibility that it could still be linked to you in the future even though personal 
information is removed from the sample. A new law prevents employers and health 
insurers from using genetic information to make hiring or insurance decisions. 
• Your tissue could be used in research you would find personally objectionable. It is 
impossible to predict what kinds of research could be performed in the future. Some 
research may be controversial or sensitive and you will not be able to select in which 
research your tissue might be used. When you agree to donate tissue, you agree to allow 
Houston Methodist Hospital, its researchers and collaborators to use the tissue in any 
research that the hospital IRB committee approves. 
Are there any financial considerations? 
• There will be no cost to you if you decide to donate tissue. 
• You will not be paid for your tissue. 
• If a commercial product is developed from a research project that used your sample, the 
commercial product will be owned by the sponsor and you will not receive any money or 
rights to the product, 
How will your privacy and the confidentiality be protected? 
Houston Methodist Tissue Bank personnel will take careful steps to prevent private 
information that could identify you from being released. 
• Personal information will be taken off any record associated with your tissue before it is 
studied. 
• A code number will be assigned to the tissue. 
• Researchers may publish or present their research results in scientific journals or at 
scientific meetings but will not include any information that will let others know who you 
are. 
How long will you participqte and will you be contacted? 
If you agree to donate your tissue, it will be saved after the testing for your care is completed. 
You will not need to do anything and no further participation is required. However, there might 
be situations when additional information is needed. If you agree to be contacted, the tissue 
bank may give your contact information to committee-approved researchers.

AUTHORIZATION TO USE AND DISCLOSE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION 
By signing below, you consent to the use of your excess tissue/blood/body fluid/cell samples 
and authorize the use and disclosure of your personal health information for research as 
described in the previous pages. 
I have voluntarily agreed to donate my tissue, blood, bodily fluids or cells ('tissue") to The 
Methodist Hospital to be used for medical research. I understand that Houston Methodist Hospital 
will not condition treatment, payment, or enrollment or eligibility for benefits (as applicable) on 
whether I agree to this authorization. As part of this donation, I understand and agree that 
Houston Methodist Hospital may use my personal health information in conducting medical 
research on my tissue. It may also release my personal health information to other researchers 
or institutions, or to government agencies, as pan of Houston Methodist Hospital's research. 
Finally, I understand that Houston Methodist Hospital may release my personal information to 
other researchers or institutions who may wish to conduct their own research on my tissue. 
This authorization is valid until all research activities directly or indirectly related to the tissue 
bank program of Houston Methodist Hospital are terminated, or until I revoke it. I understand 
that I may revoke this authorization at any time and any identifiable tissue that has not been 
released from the tissue bank will be destroyed. I understand that the revocation will not apply 
to information that already has been released or actions that have already been taken in 
response to this authorization. I understand that if I revoke this authorization, I must do so by 
contacting Dr. Alberto Ayala, or his designee in Houston Methodist Hospital Department of 
Pathology at 713-441-1339 or write to the Pathology Depanment MS 205, 6565 Fannin, 
Houston. TX 77030. I have a right to request a copy of any of my health information that is 
released under this authorization. 
I understand that other researchers or institutions to which Houston Methodist Hospital may 
release my health information may not be covered by Federal or Texas privacy laws. As such, 
my information may not be protected under these laws once it is disclosed and, therefore, 
may be subject to re-disclosure or use by such individuals or institutions. 
I will be a given a copy of this form to keep.

is needed.
