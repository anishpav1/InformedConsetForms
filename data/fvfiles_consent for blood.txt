Blood Transfusion
Questions and Answers

What is a transfusion?
During your treatment, we may need to give you
blood. This is called a transfusion. Blood is given
through a needle in the vein. It takes 1 to 4 hours.
It may include:

What is the risk of getting a disease from
a transfusion?
The chances are low. Donors are carefully screened
before giving blood. Also, before any donated blood
is used, it must be tested for infectious diseases.

• Red blood cells. These help replace blood you
may have lost through bleeding or illness. They
will increase your blood’s ability to carry oxygen.

Here are example of your risk for infection:

• Platelets. These help blood to clot. They are
used for low platelet counts and some bleeding
disorders.

• Hepatitis C: 1 in 1.8 million

• Plasma and cryoprecipitate. These help the blood
to clot. They are used to treat some bleeding
disorders.
• Granulocytes (a type of white blood cell).
These help your body fight infection.
If you need a transfusion, your doctor will prescribe
one. We will ask you to sign a consent form before
your first transfusion. Do not sign this form until all
your questions have been answered.
Before your transfusion, we will double check your
identity for your safety.

What are some of the side effects?

What are the risks of not having a transfusion?

While most transfusions have no side effects, you
could have some of the symptoms listed below. If
you think you may be having a reaction, tell your
doctor or nurse right away.

• Anemia (low red blood cells). This might cause a
fast heartbeat and make you feel weak, tired, and
breathless. If severe, it might lead to organ failure
and death.

Common reactions include:

• Bleeding. If your blood doesn’t clot well, blood
loss might lead to anemia, brain damage or death.

• Fever or chills
• Skin rash, hives, itching or flushing

• Weaker immune system. Your body might be less
able to fight infection or heal wounds.

• Wheezing or trouble breathing

Are there other options besides transfusion?
• Chest or back pain
Medicine (such as erythropoietin or iron pills) can
cause the body to make more red blood cells. It may
take months to replace all of the red blood cells you
have lost.

• Facial swelling
• New or ongoing cough
• Bruising
• Red or brown urine, or less urine output

In some cases, you can donate your own blood before
surgery. The blood may be given back to you during
your surgery. This is called autologous donation.

• Jaundice (yellow eyes and skin)
• Irritation at the infusion site.
Some symptoms may occur up to four weeks after a
transfusion. If you have any kind of symptom, call
your doctor.
