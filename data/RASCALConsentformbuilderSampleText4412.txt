Risks
Text Sub-Heading WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? RISKS General risks

There may be risks or discomforts if you take part in this study. These include: [DESCRIBE ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PHYSICAL, INFORMATIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL RISKS, DISCOMFORTS OR SIDE EFFECTS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE OCCURRENCE]. 

[IF APPLICABLE, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT] There may be other risks of taking part in this research study that we don't know about. If we learn about other risks, we will let you know what they are so that you can decide whether or not you want to continue to be in the study. 
General risks Radiation 

Radiation is an energy that is all around us. It is in the air, water, food, and ground. This is called natural radiation.

Radiation is also made by man. It is in our buildings and homes. It is also in medical examinations or treatments such as X-rays. The energy used in X-rays and some other types of scans (such as bone density and Positron Emission Tomography, or PET, scans) is known as radiation.

Radiation and the risks of receiving radiation are hard to measure. Experts on radiation agree that there is some risk because radiation exposure adds up over our lifetime. You should always carefully think about how much radiation you will receive from medical examinations or treatments. 

A millirem (mrem) is a way of measuring radiation. On the average, each person in the United States receives about 300 mrem every year from natural radiation.

People also receive about 60 mrems of radiation every year from other things such as a chest or dental X-rays, or from flying in an airplane. For example, if you have a chest X-ray you will receive about 8 mrems of radiation. If you fly in an airplane from Washington DC to Los Angeles, California and back, you will receive about 5 mrems of radiation. 

This research study includes exposure to radiation. If you have had X-rays in the past or been exposed in other ways to radiation, or if you think that you might be pregnant, you must tell the investigator before you agree to be in the study.

In this study, you will receive radiation from [IDENTIFY PROCEDURE OR PROCEDURES THAT INVOLVE RADIATION]. The estimated total radiation you will receive from the procedures in this study is [INSERT MREM]. This is about equal to [INSERT EXAMPLE SUCH AS CHEST X-RAY(S) OR AIR TRAVEL]. 
Radiation risks Pregnancy/breastfeeding risks 

Taking part in this study while you are pregnant could cause harm to your fetus. If you are breastfeeding, taking part in this study could cause harm to your baby. You must not take part in this study if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are a sexually active woman of childbearing age and would like to take part in this study you will have to agree to use two methods of birth control. One must be a barrier method (male or female condom) and the other can be one of the following:
o Birth control drugs that prevent pregnancy given by pills, shots, or placed on or under the skin
o Diaphragm or cervical cap with a cream or gel that kills sperm
o Intrauterine device (IUD)

[INSERT THE FOLLOWING IF BIRTH CONTROL SHOULD BE USED AFTER DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY DRUG AND FOR HOW LONG] 
You must continue to use both methods of birth control for [INSERT LENGTH OF TIME] after you stop taking study drugs.

If you think that you have become pregnant while taking part in this study you must contact the investigator or study team right away. [INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP REQUIREMENTS] 
Risks for pregnant or breastfeeding women No Foreseeable Risk

To the best of our knowledge, taking part in this study will not hurt you. 
No foreseeable risk Blood Draw

Risks of having blood drawn are soreness and/or a black and blue mark at the site from where the blood is drawn. Sometimes, people feel uncomfortable at the time of the blood draw. Occasionally people feel lightheaded or faint. There is also a small risk of infection whenever blood is drawn. 
Risk of blood draw Inconvenience

Although it is not a risk, taking part in this study involves the inconvenience of giving [INSERT AMOUNT OF TIME] of your time in order to [INDICATE WHAT THEY WILL SPEND THEIR TIME DOING - I.E., COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE]. 
Inconvenience Deception

As part of this experiment you will not be told about some of the study details. If you were told these details at the beginning of the study, it could change the research results. If you decide to be part of the study, you will be given an explanation of what information was withheld from you at the end of your study participation. 
Deception Psychological Testing/Sensitive Topics 

This research study involves psychological testing. The questions being asked may be sensitive and personal in nature. It is possible that answering some questions may cause some stress. [INSERT OPTIONS TO SUBJECT IF THEY SHOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE PROVIDING A RESPONSE OR BECOME DISTRESSED, I.E., THEY CAN SKIP ANY QUESTIONS THEY WISH, THEY WILL BE REFERRED FOR COUNSELING, ETC.] Risk from sensitive questions Loss of confidentiality 

A risk of taking part in this study is the possibility of a loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality includes having your personal information shared with someone who is not on the study team and was not supposed to see or know about your information. The study team plans to protect your confidentiality. Their plans for keeping your information private are described in the 'confidentiality' section of this consent form. 
Risk of breach of confidentiality Criminal or Civic Liability - Child Abuse

If you give us information which suggests that your child or any other child is being abused, we are required by law to report that information to the Administration for Children's Services (ACS). Reporting this information may put you, your family, or others who are involved at risk of questioning and legal action by the authorities. 
Risk related to reporting (child abuse) liability Criminal or Civic Liability - Illegal Activities 

Telling us about your involvement in illegal activities involves the risk of criminal penalties and/or prosecution if your identity were to be revealed. In some cases, we may be required to report such information.

If you give us information that you may hurt yourself or someone else, we must report this information to the authorities. 
Risk related to reporting (illegal activities) liability

Confidentiality protections Certificate of Confidentiality 

To help us protect your privacy, we received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With this Certificate, we cannot be forced to provide information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. We will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.

The Certificate of Confidentiality does not stop you or a member of your family from telling others about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person gets your written consent to receive research information, then we cannot use the Certificate to withhold that information.

The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from representatives of the United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of projects they are responsible for overseeing or for information that must be provided in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

You should also know that this Certificate does not protect you from our responsibility to report certain communicable diseases, suspected child abuse, or danger of physical or mental harm, to appropriate agencies or authorities.
