The following definitions may help you understand the purpose of this study: (Keep all of the definitions that apply to this study.  Add others study design elements as necessary to aid understanding.)
* Cell Line: A group of cells that can live and divide outside of the body; these cells can be frozen for storage for an indefinite period of time and can be used for future research.
* Somatic Cells:  Any cell in the body except gametes (eggs or sperm). Skin cells and blood cells are types of somatic cells.


PURPOSE OF STUDY*	
The purpose of this research is to develop human stem cell lines from the somatic cells you have provided. Human stem cells have the unique combination of capacities to divide with no known limit and to develop into most of the different types of cells of the body. These stem cell lines will be used for basic science experimentation and may be used at some future time for human transplantation research. If appropriate add:  The donated somatic cells can be genetically manipulated so that they behave like stem cells. The cells after genetic manipulation are called "induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells". 

The stem cells lines that are developed will be used to study... (Complete this sentence and include an explanation of what cells are being used and why. Examples include "to develop a stem cell line that will allow researchers to study Huntington's disease in a human model system, and provide a cell model to screen new drugs for treatment."  


SUBJECTS*
Inclusion Requirements
You are eligible to participate in this study if you... (Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list of inclusion criteria) Examples include, "are at least 18 years of age or older," "you or a member of your family has Huntington's disease."

Exclusion Requirements DO NOT LIST THE CONVERSE OF THE INCLUSION CRITERIA
You are not eligible to participate in this study if you... (Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list of exclusion criteria) Examples include, "you have had uncontrolled high blood
pressure within the past 6 months; you smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day."

Number of Participants and Time Commitment
This study will include approximately       subjects and will involve approximately       of your time over the next       weeks/months.


PROCEDURES*
The following procedures will occur: (Provide a detailed explanation of the research procedures in chronological order; include the expected duration of each procedure or each visit and the procedures to be completed at the visit. You may provide a visit schedule, chart, or calendar to assist the participant. Explain where the work will be conducted, the types of experiments that will be performed, whether new cell lines will be established, how they will be established, and how they will be used. Indicate that the cells may multiply indefinitely.)  Example language:

* We will ask for a skin sample from you. The skin sample is obtained by a process called a "punch biopsy". In this procedure, a small area of skin on the thigh or arm is cleaned and injected with xylocaine, a local anesthetic. When the skin is numb, a small round blade of three millimeters (one-eighth of an inch) in diameter is pressed into the skin, creating a circular cut approximately one eighth of an inch deep. This round piece of skin is then removed, pressure is applied to stop any bleeding and the resulting hole in the skin is covered with a sterile bandage. In some cases one or two stitches are required. The biopsy takes about ten minutes to perform, including time for cleaning and preparation. We will only ask for one punch biopsy.

If samples will be sent out of UCI for analysis or other purposes, include the statement: Your samples will be sent outside of UCI for... (Provide an explanation of where the sample will be sent and why).

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) research should additionally include information about Genetic Reprogramming. Individuals must initial and date their consent to use their somatic cells for iPS or other methods of genetic reprogramming. Example language:

Genetic Reprogramming (e.g. induced Pluripotent Stem Cells or iPS) is when certain genes are put into your somatic cells to study how the cells can be changed, or reprogrammed, into embryonic-like cells.

Stem cell lines may be made from the method described above. Cells multiply by dividing in two, and the genetic material is replicated every time a cell divides. It is possible that these lines, which can live indefinitely, may contain all or part of your DNA.

Any cell lines created may be kept for many years and may be used in further studies, by researchers at UCI or other research institutions outside of UCI, which cannot be predicted at the present time. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation.

It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There are no restrictions on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Genetics [REQUIRED - if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information]
As part of the study, the researcher may do genetic testing or access genetic information. Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children. Genetic research may also include genetically modifying cells that are derived from your tissues to better understand how genes function.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications, and responses to treatment.  
[Standard Template] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.

[Alternative Template for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against individuals based on their genetic information. This means that they may not use genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/Genetic Discrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.  

Use of Specimens
All of the [indicate cell type and/or tissue] obtained for the purposes described in this consent form will become the property of the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  After 30 days the donation is irrevocable. These materials will be used for research and such use may result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial or other products that may be developed from use of the donated materials.  


FUTURE RESEARCH
Your tissue, cells or other materials derived from these tissues may be used by other researchers at UCI or by researchers at institutions outside of UCI in future studies, which are currently undefined. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. However, the tissue, cells or other materials will not contain any identifiable information about you (for example it will not include your name, social security or medical record number). 

It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There can be no restrictions placed on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products, except in the case where the donation is intended for autologous transplantation (where you, the donor, would also be the recipient).

The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes and tissue derivatives may also be used in human therapies.

You must be given the opportunity to impose restrictions on future uses of donated materials. However, researchers may choose to use materials only from donors who agree to all future uses without restrictions.
