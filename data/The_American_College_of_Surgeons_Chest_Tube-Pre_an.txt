Tube Placement)

Communication with my Doctor

John Smith has eXoIained the following information:
o Oooeration/rocedure:

This procedure involves draining air or fluid from around the |ung(s).

Your doctorwill inject local anesthetic. This is a medicine that numbs the treatment
site. You may also be given IV sedation. Your surgeon will make a small out between
your ribs in the chest wall. A flexible hollow drainage tube will be inserted. Your
surgeon will manually push the tube to the fluid or air pocket. An x-ray of the chest will
be taken to ensure correct tube placement. It will let your surgeon check that the fluid
or air is draining effectively. The tube may be secured in place with stitches or tape
until removal at a later time.

The tube is attached to either a chest tube canister containing a water seal, or a
Heimlick valve. These devices will make sure that blood, fluid, or air only flows out and
cannot back up through the tube. Sometimes, the drain will become blocked. Ifthis
occurs, your doctor may flush the tube with medications to help it continue to drain
without having to replace the tube. Depending on how serious your condition is, you
may need more than one chest tube.
