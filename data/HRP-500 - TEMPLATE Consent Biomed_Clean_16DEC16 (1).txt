[The following language is recommended when samples of tissues, cells, blood, or body fluids (hereafter referred to as tissues) will be taken or banked for use in current or future research.  This includes testing the sample for purposes of collecting genetic or other information.  Investigators should choose the appropriate provisions to be included in their informed consent form and may vary any of the following language as appropriate.]

Tissue Sampling for Research 
Research using tissues is an important way to try to understand human disease.  You have been given this information because the investigators want to include your tissues in a research project and because they want to save the samples for future research.  There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues to be studied.  
Your tissues will be stored [insert how samples will be stored - and if appropriate how samples will be linked) e.g., under diagnosis and medical record or code number and unlinked].   
[If linked]: You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be studied now or saved for future study.  You may withdraw from this study at any time.  The investigators might retain the identified samples, e.g., as part of your routine clinical care, but not for additional research. 

[If unlinked]: Because your samples will not be linked to your name after they are stored, you cannot withdraw your consent to the use of the samples after they are taken.  
 
[Optional]:
The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests. 
[Or]
You will be told the results of tests that are part of your clinical care, but you will not be told the results of the research tests, including any future research tests. 

	_____ I consent to my samples being saved for future research

	_____ I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research

Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing
[Include the following language if samples in study will be used for genetic testing or if future research on samples will include genetic testing.]
As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators (may/will) do genetic testing.  Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment.  Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results.  Possible risks of knowing results include:  anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination.  A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. 
Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. 
[If investigators will not share the research results with the participant, the following language can be added]: 
The results of the study of your samples from this project will be used for research purposes only, and you will not be told the results of the tests. 

[If investigators will allow participants to choose whether they want to receive test results and/or will contact participants in the future, the following language (two choices of language) can be added]: 
Regarding informing you of the test results, you should understand the following: 
* The information may be too limited to give you particular details or consequences; 
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated;
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment; 
* You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene.  
Please circle [ yes or no ] as to whether you wish to be told the test results.
Please circle [ yes or no ] as to whether you wish your family members to be told the test results.
[Or]
Investigators in this study may try to re-contact you in the future.  If you are re-contacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your tissue samples, you should understand the following: 
* The information may be too limited to give you particular details or consequences; 
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated;
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment; 
* You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene.  

[If you would like to contact participants about future studies, include the following statement]:  

*May we contact you about future studies that may be of interest to you?   
____ Yes  ____ No

How will my privacy and health information be protected?
