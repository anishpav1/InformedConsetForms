steroid medicines should not have a non-surgical abortion. You should discuss with your physician whether
you have any medical conditions that would make a medical abortion unsafe for you.

Minor’s Initials

Please review the applicable description of the procedure and the associated risks and hazards planned for the minor
(Minor should initial the applicable procedure):

Medical (Nonsurgical) Abortion

Medical abortion is a way to end a pregnancy by using an abortion inducing drug as an alternative to surgical
procedures. The Food and Drug Administration allows this type of abortion up to 49 days (7 weeks) after the last
menstrual period. The gestational age must be determined before a physician can administer these drugs to a
pregnant woman.

The physician administering the medicines (such as Mifepristone RU 486) for medical termination of early
pregnancy must be able to provide surgical intervention or have made plans for provision of such care through
other qualified physicians, and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood
transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.

Methods of Non-surgical Abortion

Oklahoma law (Title 63 0.8. §l-729a) states that the physician administering any abortion inducing drug must be
able to determine the duration of the pregnancy accurately, be able to diagnose ectopic pregnancies, be able to
provide surgical intervention or have made plans for provision of such care through other qualified physicians,
and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and
resuscitation, if necessary. The physician administering Mifepristone (RU 486) is required to fully explain the
procedure to the patient including whether the physician is using the drug in accordance with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration tested and authorized protocol. If the physician is using an evidence-based regimen, the
physician must provide detailed information on the regimen being used. In addition, the physician who is
prescribing, dispensing, or otherwise providing an abortion inducing drug must be physically present in the same
room as the patient when the drug or chemical is first provided to the patient (Title 63 0.8. §l-729.1)

Mifepristone (RU 486), Misoprostol, and Methotrexate are drugs used in regimens for medical termination of
early pregnancies. These drugs are given by mouth or placed in the woman’s vagina. These drugs cause abortion
by causing the uterus to contract and expel the fetus and placenta.

After receiving these drugs, you might experience cramping and bleeding, pass clots, tissue, and the unborn
child within hours or days. Some amount of bleeding is common following a medical abortion.

Your doctor will tell you when you need to return to be checked. Ifyou are still pregnant at that visit, you will be
given a second drug either by mouth or vaginally. You will be instructed when to return for an important follow-
up visit. Your doctor will determine whether your pregnancy has completely ended. If you are still pregnant, a
surgical procedure could be necessary.

Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)
Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is a surgical abortion procedure used within 1 to 3 weeks following a missed
menstrual cycle.

To prepare for the procedure, the doctor first opens (dilates) the cervix by gradually stretching with a series of
dilators. A cannula (small tube) and attached syringe is inserted into the uterus. A vacuum is created in the
syringe causing the uterus to be emptied and the tissue of the unborn child to be collected in the syringe.

The termination of the pregnancy is to be confirmed by the examination of the contents of the syringe and a
sonogram, using a vaginal probe, to make certain that all pregnancy related tissue has been completely
evacuated. In addition, for very early stages of pregnancy, the bloodstream is tested to verify the levels of
pregnancy-related hormones to try to better verify the termination of the pregnancy.

Possible Complications of Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA):
o Cramping of the uterus or pelvic pain.

Perforated uterus (a hole in the uterus) - very rarely.

A cut or torn cervix (cervical laceration) - very ra rely.

Anesthesia-related complication - very rarely.

Incomplete abortion - very rarely - pregnancy tissue left inside the uterus, repeated vacuum

aspiration may be necessary.

0 Infection - very rarely - medication for the infection, or in rare cases, repeated vacuum aspiration
might be needed.

0 Fertility can be diminished in very rare instances as a consequence of infection.

0 Heavy bleeding - very rarely - a hemorrhage develops; medication, repeated vacuum aspiration,
surgery or blood transfusion might be needed.

0 Vary rarely - emergency treatment for any of the above problems, including the possible need to
treat with an operation, medicines, or blood transfusion.

0 Very rarely - death.

Dilatation and Curettage (D&C) with Vacuum Aspiration

This is a surgical procedure used in the first 12 weeks (LMP) of pregnancy. The doctor first opens (dilates) the
cervix by gradually stretching with a series of dilators. Then the doctor empties the uterus with suction. After
suctioning, the doctor may scrape the walls of the uterus to make sure the unborn child, placenta, and contents
of the uterus have been completely removed.

Possible Complications of Dilatation and Curettage (D&C)
o Cramping of the uterus or pelvic pain.

Perforated uterus (a hole in the uterus) - very rarely.

Injury to the bowel or the bladder - very rarely.

A cut or torn cervix (cervical laceration) - very ra rely.

Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E)

Since this procedure is generally used after 12 weeks (LMP) of pregnancy, the doctorwill often use ultrasound to
determine how far along you are in your pregnancy.

To prepare for the procedure, the doctorwill open (dilate) the cervix. Most women experience some pain, so
the doctor may administer a painkiller: either locally by shots in the area of the cervix, or by a general
anesthetic, or a sedative (which will leave you conscious). The uterus will be scraped and the unborn child and
placenta are removed with medical instruments. After 16 weeks, the unborn child and placenta are removed
piece-by-piece, using forceps or other instruments, followed by a vacuum curette used to remove the placenta
and remaining tissue.

Possible Complications and Risks of Dilatation and Evacuation
o Perforated uterus (a hole in the uterus) - very rarely.
Blood clots in the uterus - very rarely.
Injury to the bowel or bladder - very rarely.
A cut or torn cervix (cervical laceration) - very ra rely.
Infection - very rarely - medication for the infection, or in rare cases, repeated vacuum aspiration
might be needed.

Abortion by Labor Induction (Including Intra-Uterine lnstillation)

This procedure is generally used after 16 weeks (LMP) of pregnancy and before the viability of the unborn child,
unless such abortion is necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent impairment to her
health.

In a medically induced abortion, medicines will be used to start labor. Labor induction may require a hospital
stay. These medicines can be put in the vagina, injected in the uterus (womb), or given into the vein
(intravenously or by IV). The medicines used cause the uterus to contract and labor to begin. More than one
drug might be used.

This procedure may take from several hours to several days.

Your doctor may find it necessary to use instruments to scrape the uterus and make sure that the unborn child,
placenta, and other contents of the uterus have been completely removed.

Possible Complications of Abortion by Labor Induction

o Nausea.

o Vomiting.

o Diarrhea.

o Fever.

0 Anesthesia - related complications - very rarely.

o A cut or torn cervix (cervical laceration) - very ra rely.

0 Blood clots in the uterus - very rarely.

o Adverse reactions to the medications - very rarely.

0 Fertility can be diminished in very rare instances as a consequence ofinfection.

0 Very rarely - emergency treatment for any of the above problems, including the possible need to
treat with an operation, medicines, or a blood transfusion.

0 Very rarely - death.

Who should not have an abortion by medical induction?

Some women should not have a medical induction such as a woman who has had previous surgery to the uterus
or a woman with placenta previa (misplaced placenta). You should discuss with your doctor if you are one of
these women.

Dilatation and Extraction (D&X)

Dilatation and Extraction (D&X), referred to in political terminology as partial birth abortion, is a procedure that
has been used generally after 16 weeks (LMP) of pregnancy. When conditions occur that permit the use of this
abortion method, the following procedure is used:

The doctor will dilate (open) the cervix by gradually stretching with a series of dilators. Once the cervix is
sufficiently dilated, the body is extracted through the dilated cervix (intact) to minimize uterine or cervical injury
to the woman from instruments orfetal bones, afterwhich the doctor will suction the intracranial contents,
collapsing the skull.

This surgical method is similar to the D&E procedure except that suction evacuation of the intracranial contents
occurs after the extraction of the intact body of the unborn child through the dilated cervix.

Possible Complications of Dilatation and Extraction

o A cut or torn cervix (cervical laceration) - very ra rely.

o Anesthesia - related complications - very rarely.

0 Blood clots in the uterus - very rarely.

0 Heavy bleeding - very rarely - a hemorrhage develops; medication, or blood transfusion might be
needed.

0 Incomplete removal of the placenta, or contents of the uterus - very rarely- vacuum aspiration may
be necessary.

0 Infection - very rarely - medication for the infection, or in rare cases, repeated vacuum aspiration
might be needed.

0 Fertility can be diminished in very rare instances as a consequence ofinfection.

0 Very rarely - emergency treatment for any of the above problems, including the possible need to
treat with an operation, medicines, or a blood transfusion.

0 Very rarely - death.
