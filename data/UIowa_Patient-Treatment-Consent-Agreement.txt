Patient Treatment Consent/Agreement
Consent to Treatment
The undersigned consents to radiographs (x-rays), laboratory procedures, anesthesia, diagnostic tests, dental
treatment, or other procedures rendered to the patient under the supervision of dental faculty. Although the
undersigned may elect not to undergo certain specific procedures, without adequate diagnosis or treatment plan
the College may decline to treat the patient.
Privacy Practices
The College of Dentistry’s Notice of Privacy Practices is available to the undersigned via our website or in paper
form by request. The undersigned consents to the use and disclosure of his/her health information to carry out
treatment and health care operations. In order to assist in the improvement of dental care, the undersigned
authorizes representatives of the College of Dentistry to use all or part of the patient's record including written
records, radiographs, photographs, videotapes, and laboratory reports for teaching so long as the patient is not
identified by name in connection therewith. The undersigned has the right to revoke consent at any time by
written notice; however, we may decline to treat the patient if this consent is revoked.
Patient Rights and Responsibilities
The undersigned hereby acknowledges that the College’s Patient Rights and Responsibilities brochure is
available to him/her via our website or in paper form.
Financial Agreement
The undersigned agrees, whether he/she signs as agent or as patient, he/she hereby individually obligates
himself/herself to pay for treatment received at the College of Dentistry in accordance with the regular rates and
terms of the College. Failure to pay for services in a timely manner may jeopardize the patient's access to
routine dental care. In the event the patient’s account is transferred to a bad debt collection agency the
undersigned may be responsible for reasonable attorney's fees and collection expenses.
Minors and Dependent Adults
The parent (or legal guardian) of patients under the age of 18 (or dependent adults) must be registered as the
guarantor; the guarantor’s name and physical address is required. Either parent may be held responsible for
payment of treatment rendered to their minor child or dependent adult. The College of Dentistry’s policy is to bill
the parent/legal guardian who presented the minor/dependent adult for treatment. The same applies to
minors/dependent adults of divorced parents.
Insurance
The College of Dentistry submits to insurance as a courtesy to our patients; balances after insurance are billed
to the guarantor. Ultimately, the guarantor is responsible for payment, regardless of the insurance carrier’s
consideration. Insurance claims for services by pre-doctoral and graduate students are submitted under the
name of a faculty member, whose name will appear on insurance documents. .
The undersigned authorizes the University of Iowa College of Dentistry to submit claims (on the patient's behalf)
to insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payer(s) and to disclose health information to the extent
necessary to obtain payment. The undersigned also assigns benefits paid by insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or
other third party payer(s) directly to the University of Iowa College of Dentistry. In consideration of the dental
services provided, the undersigned assigns to the College any benefits to which the undersigned may be entitled
to receive, including without limitation any such benefits due or claims the undersigned has under or pursuant to
a benefit plan governed under ERISA, 29 USC sec. 101 et seq.

I have reviewed the College of Dentistry Financial Policy as stated above and I understand and accept
responsibility of cooperating with these policies. I understand that I will be responsible for financial balances
resulting from treatment received that is not paid by my insurance company, Medicare, Medicaid, or any third
party agency. My signature acknowledges that I understand and accept the above College of Dentistry
agreement.
