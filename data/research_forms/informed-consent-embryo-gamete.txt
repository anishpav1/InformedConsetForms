The following definitions may help you understand the purpose of this study: (Keep all of the definitions that apply to this study. Add other study design elements as necessary to aid understanding.)

* Blastocyst: A very early embryo consisting of approximately 100 to 150 cells. The blastocyst consists of a sphere made up of an outer layer of cells, a fluid-filled cavity, and a cluster of cells on the interior.  The cluster of cells on the interior of the blastocyst is used to derive stem cell lines.
* Cell Line: A group of cells that can live and divide outside of the body; these cells can be frozen for storage for an indefinite period of time and can be used for future research.
* Embryo:  The developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it becomes known as a fetus.
* Gamete:  An egg or sperm.
* Human Embryonic Stem Cells:  Primitive cells derived from early human embryos that have the potential to become a wide variety of specialized cell types. 
* Somatic Cells:  Any cell in the body except gametes (eggs or sperm). Skin cells are a type of somatic cells.


PURPOSE OF STUDY*	
The purpose of this research is to develop human stem cell lines from the materials and samples you have provided. Human stem cells have the unique combination of capacities to divide with no known limit and to develop into most of the different types of cells of the body. These stem cell lines will be used for basic science experimentation and may be used at some future time for human transplantation research. 
This research involves donation of embryos or gametes to derive human stem cell lines for research purposes. The cells will come from very early embryos, called blastocysts, or gametes. Although the human stem cell lines can be derived from embryos, the stem cells themselves are not embryos. The stem cell lines will be used to study...(Complete this sentence. You may consider using one or more of the statements below.)
* How stem cells differentiate (what molecular changes occur when cells divide in humans and animals).
* How stem cells respond to drugs and other compounds to develop new therapeutic treatments for human disease and disorders. 
* How stem cells may be used to create healthy tissues and cells for transplantation in humans (for example, for treating people with leukemia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and diabetes).

NEW FINDINGS*
If, during the 30 day waiting period, significant new information becomes available that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate, this information will be provided to you by the research team listed at the top of the form.


OTHER CONSIDERATIONS*
Use of Embryos [or Gametes]
All of the [embryos or gametes-be specific] obtained for the purposes described in this consent form will become the property of the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  After 30 days the donation is irrevocable.  The [embryos or gametes - be specific] and cell lines may be frozen for an undefined period of time. 

These materials will be used for research and such use may result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial or other products that may be developed from use of the donated materials.  

The donation of [embryos or gametes - be specific] is made without any restriction or direction regarding who may be the recipient of transplants of the stem cells derived, should a clinical application be discovered.  The resulting stem cell lines may be used by the research team or made available to other researchers; however, the cell lines will not contain any direct identifiable information about you (for example your name, social security or medical record number). 

Genetics (REQUIRED if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information)
As part of the study, the researcher may do genetic testing or access genetic information. Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children. Genetic research may also include genetically modifying cells that are derived from your tissues to better understand how genes function. Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medication, and responses to treatment.

[Standard Template] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.

[Alternative Template for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against individuals based on their genetic information. This means that they may not use genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/Genetic Discrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.  

Investigator Financial Conflict of Interest*
[One of the following statements is required.]
No one on the study team has a significant financial interest related to this research project.

                                                    OR

[A member of the study team or their spouse or dependent child(ren)-list study team members here] has a significant and related financial interest in [the Sponsor company or other related entity-list here].  The nature of this financial interest and the design of the study have been reviewed by the UCI Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee, and this committee has determined that the investigator's financial interests will not compromise the quality or reliability of the study.  Furthermore, the UCI Institutional Review Board has determined that the investigator's financial interests will not adversely affect your safety and welfare.


FUTURE RESEARCH
Your embryo(s), donated specimen, cells and other materials derived from these samples may be used by other researchers at UCI or by researchers at institutions outside of UCI in future studies, which are currently undefined. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. However, the materials will not contain any identifiable information about you (for example, it will not include your name, social security number or medical record number).

It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There can be no restrictions placed on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products, expect in the case where the donation is intended for autologous transplantation (where you, the donor, would also be the recipient).

The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes and tissue derivatives may also be used in human therapies.

You must be given the opportunity to impose restrictions on future uses of donated materials. However, researchers may choose to use materials only from donors who agree to all future uses without restrictions.

 I consent to my samples [name sample type] be saved for future research.
	 No restrictions.
