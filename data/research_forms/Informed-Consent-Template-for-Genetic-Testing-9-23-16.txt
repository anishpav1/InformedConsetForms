[Add this statement if this study is targeting a patient population]
Should you agree to participate in this research, a copy of Page One of this document will be included in your medical record.

Why do you want to take [and/or] store my [blood and/or tissues]?
We would like to study your genes and we can obtain those genes from your [blood/ tissue].  You are currently being asked to participate in a partner research study under the direction of [PI's name from partner study].  We are also asking you to participate in this separate research study.  This purpose of this study is to [describe purpose, such as develop a tissue bank, develop new tests to find diseases, look for relationships between genes, the environment, and people's habits or diet, and different diseases, etc].  We are asking if we may collect, then store and use, now and in the future, your [blood / tissue] sample to look at your body's genes.  You [do/do not] have to agree to have your [blood / tissue] collected, stored, or used for genetic purposes in order to take part in the partner study listed above.

Genes control how your body grows and changes, and how your body reacts to certain things.  Genes are what we get from our parents that help make our bodies what they are.  For example, eye and hair color depend on the genes we got from our parents.

We want to find out how genes work in [name the disease or condition].  It may be true that some people are more likely to have [describe the disease or condition] because of their genes.  We would like to learn more about this.

How will my [blood and/or tissue] be obtained?
If you agree to let us study your genes, we will need to take [blood / tissue] samples during the following visits:
* [Describe in plain language when these samples will be taken and how those samples will be taken, such as "The sample will be taken during one of your scheduled biopsies." Or "We will draw an extra tablespoon of blood at your first study visit."]
* The [blood / tissue] [will/will not] be taken at the same time as your study visits for the [name the partner study in which the individual is currently participating].  [If not at same time as another study visit "We will ask you to come into the [name the location] to have the [blood / tissue] sample taken, separate from your other research visits"].

OR

If you agree to let us study your genes, we will use a sample of [blood / tissue] that would normally be discarded from [state where this sample would arise if not being collected for research purposes].

[Please select the section that applies to your study from the following 3 sections (A, B, or C) and delete the two that do not apply:]

[A.	If the samples will be unlinked to the person's identity, use this section.  A line is provided at the bottom of each page for the participant to initial, indicating that he/she chooses to have genetic testing done and that the genetic testing has been adequately explained to him/her.]
1. Once the sample is taken, it will forever be separated or "unlinked" from your name.  This will protect your privacy; but it means that you will not be able to receive any results.
2. Suppose the scientists discover that your blood sample carries a gene for a disease.  Because the sample is anonymous, that is, not labeled with your name or any code linking to your name, East Carolina University (ECU) will not be able to provide you with this information.  In other words, because the blood sample has been made anonymous, information about it cannot be communicated to you.  If you are concerned about a potential genetic disease or problem, you and your doctor might choose to do a test separate from this research.  You should discuss this option with your doctor or a genetic counselor.
3. Information gathered during the research cannot be shared with your family members.  Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members but we will not be able to share that information with any family members since we will not be able to identify the family that could be affected by our findings.
4. Even though your name will not be connected to the [blood / tissue] sample, other information about you might still be connected.  For instance, information about race, ethnic background, your gender or even your medical history, might be made available to scientists studying your [blood / tissue].  Such information might be important for research or public health.  It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.
5. You can refuse to allow your [blood / tissue] to be studied or saved for future research.  However, once you agree to allow scientists to use your [blood / tissue], it will be impossible for you to withdraw that use from any research project.  This is because the sample will have been made anonymous and it will not be possible to find which sample is yours.
6. [Inform participants if subsequent investigators may be given access to samples with direct or indirect identifiers]  If you agree that your samples and related health information can be shared with other investigators, in the future, please initial the "YES" below.  If you do not want your samples to be shared with other researchers in the future, please initial the "NO".  
 YES: __________ 	NO: __________

[B.	If the samples will be linked to the person's identity but he/she will not be re-contacted, use the following paragraphs. A line is provided at the bottom of each page for the participant to initial, indicating that he/she chooses to have genetic testing done and that the genetic testing has been adequately explained to him/her.]
1. Your [blood / tissue] sample will be stored under your name or a code linked to your name.  Your identity will be protected as much as possible.  Your records might be reviewed by government officials, the East Carolina University & Medical Center IRB (UMCIRB) members or support staff, or by corporate research sponsors.  The University works with many other organizations, and information is sometimes shared among them.  However, no information shared with other investigators will include your name or other identifier.
2. Genetic information about you sometimes applies to other family members.  It is not generally ECU's policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members.  However, certain studies, called "pedigree studies", share such information among family members.  This research does/ does not involve sharing genetic information about you with other family members.[If study does share]  If you are willing to have that information shared, please initial the "YES" below and sign this consent addendum.  If you do not want that to occur, initial beside the "NO" to indicate you do not want information shared with your family members.  YES: __________ 	NO: __________
3. In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your [blood / tissue] sample.  For instance, information about your race, ethnic group, gender, or even your medical history, might be available to investigators studying your [blood / tissue].  Such information might be important for research or public health.  It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.
4. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you of any results, now or in the future.  Some people want to know what is found; others do not.  The risks of knowing include anxiety and other mental distress, and the possibility of insurance discrimination.  The risks of not knowing include not being aware of the need for treatment.  But these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease.  It will also depend on how clear the results are from this study.  A process called "genetic counseling" is often useful and appropriate when people are learning about their genes.  You should ask your doctor if you would like to learn more about this.
5. In this study, investigators will not tell you what they find out about you, nor will they contact you if a test becomes available to diagnose a condition you might have or later develop.  For instance, suppose the investigators discover that your tissue sample carries a gene for a disease.  Neither ECU nor the Principal Investigator on this study will try to contact you to tell you about this discovery.  While we might not know how to test for a particular disease gene today, we might be able to test for it in the future.  The number of genes for which this will be possible in the future is quite large.
6. There are alternatives to notification by investigators.  If you are concerned about a potential genetic problem or disease, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for that genetic disorder.  You should discuss this option with your doctor or a genetic counselor.
7. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease.  Informing people of all such markers without a medical need can cause unnecessary worry.  On the other hand, the absence of a genetic marker does not mean that an individual will not get the disease.  "Genetic diseases" appear as a result of a complex mixture of genes, the environment, behavior, and other factors.
8. If you decide that you no longer wish for the specimens to be stored, you should contact the researchers on the front page of this form.  It is best to make your request in writing. Any analysis in progress at the time of your request or already performed before your request being received by the researcher will continue to be used as part of the research study.  Once the researchers have been notified, your remaining specimens would be destroyed.   
9. [If samples are going to be linked, the PI may want to consider obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality to protect the identity of the person volunteering his/her samples.]  Because your identity will be linked to your sample, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality that adds additional assurances that we will not have to release your name or identity to anyone, even if that information is requested by the court.
10. [Inform participants if subsequent investigators may be given access to samples with direct or indirect identifiers]  If you agree that your samples and pertinent health information can be shared with other investigators, in the future, please initial the "YES" below.  If you do not want your samples to be shared with other researchers in the future, please initial the "NO".  
 YES: __________ 	NO: __________

[C.	If the samples will be linked to the person's identity and he/she may be recontacted, use the following paragraphs.  A line is provided at the bottom of each page for the participant to initial, indicating that he/she chooses to have genetic testing done and that the genetic testing has been adequately explained to him/her.]
1. Your  [blood / tissue] sample will be stored under your name or a code linked to your name.  Your privacy will be protected as much as possible.  Your records might be reviewed by government officials, the East Carolina University & Medical Center IRB members or support staff, or by corporate research sponsors.  ECU works with many other organizations, and information is sometimes shared among them.  However, no information will be shared with other investigators that include your name or other identifier.
2. If you decide that you no longer wish for the specimens to be stored, you should contact the researchers on the front page of this form.  It is best to make your request in writing. Any analysis in progress at the time of your request or already performed prior to your request being received by the researcher will continue to be used as part of the research study.  Once the researchers have been notified, your remaining specimens would be destroyed.  
3. Genetic information about you sometimes applies to other family members.  It is not generally ECU's policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members.  However, certain studies, called "pedigree studies", share such information among family members.  This research [does/ does not] involve sharing genetic information about you with other family members.  [If study does share, include the following:"If you are willing to have that information shared, please initial the "YES" below and sign this consent addendum. If you do not want that to occur, initial beside the "No" to indicate you do not want information shared with your family members.  YES: __________ 	NO: __________"]
4. In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your [blood / tissue] sample.  For instance, information about race, ethnic background, gender or even your medical history might be available to investigators studying your  [blood / tissue].  Such information might be important for research or public health.  It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.
5. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you of any results, now or in the future.  Some people want to know what is discovered; others do not.  The risks of knowing include anxiety and other mental distress, and the possibility of insurance discrimination.  The risks of not knowing include not being aware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease.  It also depends on how clear the results are from this research.  A process called "genetic counseling" is often useful and appropriate when people are learning about their genes.  You should ask your doctor if you would like to learn more about this.
6. The Investigator may try to get in touch with you in the future, to find out about your health, but this is not certain.  If you are contacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your  [blood / tissue] sample, you should understand that one or more of the following are the kinds of things the investigators might tell you:
a) Information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project;
b) You carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated;
c) You carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment and this news might cause severe worry or other mental distress, depending on the severity of the disease; or
d) You carry a gene for a disease and you might consider informing relatives that they too, might carry that gene.   It can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives.  Genetic counselors can help sort out the various options in such a case.
e) Also, for any additional future research, scientists may contact you with a new consent form giving you more information about the proposed research.
7. You can choose to not wait for notification by investigators.  If you are concerned about a potential genetic problem or disease, you and your doctor might choose to do a test separate from this research.  You should discuss this option with your doctor or a genetic counselor.
8. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease.  Informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary worry.  On the other hand, the absence of a genetic marker does not mean that an individual will not get the disease.  "Genetic diseases" appear as a result of a complex mixture of genes, the environment, behavior and other factors.
9. [If samples are going to be linked, the PI may want to consider obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality to protect the identity of the person volunteering his/her samples.]  Because your identity will be linked to your samples, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality that adds additional assurances that we will not have to release your name or identity to anyone, even if that information is requested by the court.
10. [Inform participants if subsequent investigators may be given access to samples with direct or indirect identifiers]  If you agree that your samples and pertinent health information can be shared with other investigators, in the future, please initial the "YES" below.  If you do not want your samples to be shared with other researchers in the future, please initial the "NO".  
 YES: __________ 	NO: __________

[The following paragraph should be included in all genetic research studies whether data will be unlinked or linked.]
These are some of the risks and other facts you need to know about genetic research.  There might be other risks we do not know about yet.  No direct benefit can be promised from your participation, but some people get satisfaction in contributing to scientific knowledge about human genetics.  

[Describe any physical risks from obtaining the sample, such as risk of infection associated a surgical procedure, risk of fainting from blood draw, etc and any psychological risks, such as anxiety, depression, stress, etc.  Describe the safeguards in place to minimize these risks.]

A Federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  GINA also does not protect you against discrimination based on an already-diagnosed genetic condition or disease.

Will researchers seek approval from you to do future studies involving the specimens?
By signing this consent form, you are giving your permission for researchers to use your specimens as described above.  Current and future research is overseen by a committee called the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The role of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of research participants.  If other researchers want to use this data in the future, they will need to [complete this section as applicable].  In some cases, the IRB may require that you be re-contacted and asked for your consent to use your specimens  for any future research studies.  You have the right, at that future time, not to participate in any research study for which your consent is sought.  Refusal to participate will not affect your medical care or result in loss of benefits to which you are entitled.

How long will you keep my samples?
We plan to keep your samples for [indicate the length of time the sample will be stored and used, e.g. indefinitely, for five years, until a particular gene is determined for your condition].  [Provide information on what will happen to the sample once that time period is up such as the sample will be destroyed after XX years or "We will continue to use the sample until there is no more left."]   If you agree to provide us with a sample, it becomes the property of _____________.  

Will there be any cost to you for storage of the specimens or the genetic testing?
There will be no cost to you for the storage and use of the specimens for research purposes.

Will you receive anything for the use of your specimens?
If the research conducted on your sample leads to a commercially valuable product, you will not be eligible for any of the profits either because it will be impossible to identify the sample that led to the product or because you are transferring ownership of that sample.

[Choose ONE applicable sentence.  Describe payment or gift and schedule for their receipt. Address how payment will be prorated in the event the subject withdraws from the study prior to completion.   Include information about any genetic counseling that may be made available or any reimbursement for parking, transportation, etc.]

You will not receive anything for taking part in this research.

You will receive [specify] for taking part in this research.  

What will happen if you are injured by this research?
[Omit this section if the specimens have already been collected.]

If you need emergency care:  
Call 911 or [fill in appropriate number] for help.  It is important that you tell the doctors, the hospital or emergency room staff that you are taking part in a research study and the name of the Principal Investigator.  If possible, take a copy of this consent form with you when you go.  

Call the principal investigator as soon as you can.  He/she needs to know that you are hurt or ill.  Call [name of Principal Investigator] at [Telephone # where the person will most likely reach you] or [name of sub-investigator or person who can appropriately convey this information to you] at [Telephone # where the person will most likely reach the sub-investigator].  

If you do NOT need emergency care, but have been hurt or get sick:
Contact [name of the Principal Investigator] at [the best telephone number for the person to reach you.  Do not use an office number or answering service if these individuals cannot answer questions or are aware of the research.]  
Call the principal investigator as soon as you can.  As necessary, go to your regular doctor.  It is important that you tell your regular doctor that you are participating in a research study.  If possible, take a copy of this consent form with you when you go.

If necessary, the Principal Investigator or your regular doctor can assist you in identifying the appropriate place to get care.  

If you are harmed while taking part in this study: (If this is a sponsored study, it is the PI's responsibility, when drafting the informed consent, to ensure the following information matches the language agreed upon in the contract document.)

For industry-sponsored studies include the following statement:
If you believe you have been hurt or if you get sick because of something that is done during the study, you should call [Principal Investigator or medical supervisor's name] at [insert telephone number] immediately.  There are procedures in place to help attend to your injuries or provide care for you.  The sponsor of this study has some funds available to pay for care for injuries resulting directly from being in this study.  If you think that your injury is a result of taking part in this research and you think that you may be eligible for getting paid back for some of the costs associated with the care for injuries, let the Principal Investigator know right away.
(If research study is industry sponsored and the sponsor has indicated they will pay for research related injury, the following paragraph should be added to the consent) If you are injured as a result of taking part in this study, the sponsor will pay for the costs associated with your care.  However, because the sponsor is required by federal law to report that payment to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ECU will be asked to release your identifiable information (including your social security number) to the study sponsor.  The sponsor will only use your information to meet federal reporting obligations and to make any payments to you.  ECU will request your authorization before it releases information to the sponsor.  You have the right to decline this authorization.  If you decline, you will not be able to receive payment to cover the costs of medical treatment of your research related injuries and therefore you will be responsible for those costs.     
OR

For unfunded, federal, state, or foundation/non-profit studies, include the following statement: 
If you believe you have been hurt or if you get sick because of something that is done during the study, you should call [Principal Investigator or medical supervisor's name] at [insert telephone number] immediately.  There are procedures in place to help attend to your injuries or provide care for you.  Costs associated with this care will be billed in the ordinary manner, to you or your insurance company.  However, some insurance companies will not pay bills that are related to research costs.  You should check with your insurance about this.  Medical costs that result from research-related harm may also not qualify for payments through Medicare, or Medicaid.  You should talk to the Principal Investigator about this, if you have concerns.

[If required, insert Sponsor's statement about compensation for harm, here.]


What if you have questions about this research?
You have the right to ask, and have answered, any questions you may have about this research. If you have questions, you should contact the researchers listed on the first page of this form.

What if you have questions about your rights as a research subject?
If you have questions about your rights as someone taking part in research, you may call the ECU Office of Research Integrity & Compliance (ORIC) at phone number 252-744-2914 (days).  If you would like to report a complaint or concern about this research study, you may call the Director of ORIC, at 252-744-1971 [for research studies conducted through Vidant Medical Center add..."and the Vidant Medical Center Risk Management Office at 252-847-5246"].
