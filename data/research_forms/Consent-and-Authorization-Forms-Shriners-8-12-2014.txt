Introduction

When we say "you" in this consent form, we mean you or your child; "we" means the doctors and other staff. 

	You are being asked to take part in a research study. Research studies include only people who want to take part. Before you decide if you want to take part, it is important that you read and understand this consent form. Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your friends and family.  We encourage you to include your child in the discussion and decision if she or he is able to understand. Please ask questions about anything that you do not understand before deciding whether or not to participate.

	The person in charge of this study is _____________________________________.  
	There may be other people on the research team helping during the study.


Why am I being asked to take part in this study?

	You are being asked to take part in a study because you have ______.  

	We hope to learn the following:
* [List what is to be learned (objectives, in simple lay language). Use bulleted format.]


How many people will take part in the study?

	About __________ people will take part in this study.

What will happen on this study?  

	Before I begin the study... 
You will have the following tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  
* [List tests and procedures as appropriate.  Use bulleted format.]

       During the study... 
If you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures. 
* [List tests and procedures as appropriate.  Use bulleted format.]

[For randomized studies:]    You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. This means that you are put into a group by chance, like the flip of a coin. Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group you will be in.  You will have an [equal/one in three/etc.] chance of being placed in any group.

If you are in group 1 ... 

If you are in group 2 ...

When I am finished taking [drugs or intervention]...[Explain the follow-up tests, procedures, exams, etc. required, including the timing of each and whether they are part of standard care or part of standard care but being performed more often than usual or being tested in this study.  Define the length of follow-up.] 

[Optional Feature:  In addition to the mandatory narrative explanation found in the preceding text, a simplified calendar (study chart) or schema (study plan) may be inserted here. Instructions for reading the calendar or schema should be included. See example.]
  




Study Plan [Example]

	One way to see what will happen to you during the study is to look at the chart below.  Start reading at the top and read down the list, following the lines and arrows. 


                                                              


                                                                   


 


                                
                       






What will happen in this study that is "research"?  

Some of the [drugs, intervention, test] used in this study are used regularly to treat your medical condition.  Other [drugs, intervention, test] are not commonly used for these reasons so they are called experimental.  The experimental [drugs, intervention, test] in this study are:
* 

OR

	There are no experimental tests used in this study.  
	
	[If the study involves genetic research and/or storing data or specimens in a repository for future research, state that here.  Indicate whether subjects can opt out of these activities and still participate in the study.  Indicate whether future research on stored specimens may include genetic research.]

	[Suggested wording for genetic research (use all that apply, modify as appropriate):]
	The purpose of the study is to understand the inheritance of (disorder).  If a gene or genes that cause (disorder) can be found, the diagnosis and treatment of (disorder) may be improved. 

	Genes are the units of DNA--the chemical structure carrying your genetic information--that determine many human characteristics such as the color of your eyes, your height, and whether you are male or female.

	The blood/tissue samples provided by you will be analyzed in the laboratory to determine whether there are differences in the genes of people with and without (disorder). 

	[Suggested wording for repositories (modify as appropriate):]
	We are asking you to provide [blood/tissue samples/information] for a [blood/tissue/data] bank, also called a repository.  These samples will be stored indefinitely and may be used in the future for research, which may include genetic research.

	[If subjects will be contacted with genetic test results, including incidental findings, describe the disclosure procedures.  If no disclosures are to be made, explain why.  Suggested wording:]

	The results of these studies will not be made available to you because the research is still in an early phase and the reliability of the results is unknown.

	and/or

	If we discover new information that is important for your health care, either in this study or the future, you will be asked whether you wish to receive the results.  You may be required to have the test repeated in a clinical laboratory.  Because genetic information is complex and sensitive, the results should be discussed with a genetic counselor or your primary care giver who can answer your questions or discuss your concerns.  You would be responsible for all costs associated with having the test repeated and visiting a doctor or genetic counselor to discuss the results.

	and/or

	If you agree, we may contact you again in the future to update your information.


How long does the study last?

You will be asked to take [drugs or intervention] for (months, weeks/until a certain event).  After you are finished taking [drugs or intervention], the study doctor will ask you to visit the clinic for follow-up exams for at least [indicate time frames and requirements of follow-up. When appropriate, state that the study will involve long-term follow-up and specify time frames and requirements of long-term follow-up.]


Can I stop being in the study?

Yes.  You can drop out of the study at any time and no one will be upset. It will not affect your other care and treatment. 

It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so the impact, if any, from stopping the [drugs or intervention] can be discussed.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.

	Your study doctor may decide to take you off this study under the following circumstances:
* If she or he believes that it is in your best interest
* If you have side effects from the treatment that are felt to be too much
* If new information becomes available that shows another treatment would be better for you


What are the risks of the study? 
	
	This study involves no more than minimal risks, which means that we expect that you will have no more risk than those you have in your normal daily life or routine physical (or psychological) examination or tests.
OR

	You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  The risks or discomforts that we know about related to this research study are:

       Likely (happens in greater than 20% of patients)
   *   
   *       

        Less Likely (happens in 3% - 20% of patients)  
   *   
   *    

       Rare but serious (happens in less than 3% of patients)
   *   
   *     

This is not a complete list of possible side effects. 

	This study may involve risks to you or to your fetus (unborn child) if you are now pregnant or become pregnant while participating in this study. You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study. It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study. If you do become pregnant, tell your doctor right away. 

Since this is a research study and the treatments or procedures are new or different, doctors do not know all the side effects that may happen. If you notice other signs and symptoms that are not listed above, tell your doctor.

[For genetic or repository studies:  Describe risks that may result from storage of samples/information in a repository, future research studies, or genetic research.  Specifically consider and address the risks associated with breach of confidentiality or psychological trauma.  Breach of confidentiality could impact insurability, employability, family plans, and family relationships.  Psychological risks to consider include the impact of learning results if no effective therapy for the disorder exists or the risk of stigmatization.]

[For genetic studies or future research that may include genetics, state:]
A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Be aware that this federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  GINA also does not protect you against discrimination if you have already been diagnosed with the genetic disease being tested.

Although we have made every effort to protect your identity, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  If the results of these studies of your genetic makeup were to be accidentally released, it might be possible that the information we will gather about you as part of this study could become available to an insurer or an employer, or a relative, or someone else outside the study. Even though there are discrimination protections in both Oregon law and federal law, there is still a small chance that you could be harmed if a release occurred.


Are there benefits to taking part in the study?
	
	No promises are being made that you personally will benefit from this study.  Possible benefits to you or to others that might result from this research are:

* 


What other options are available to me?
	
       Your other choices may include:
* Getting standard treatment or care without being in a study
* Taking part in another study, if available
* Getting no treatment

Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.


How will information about me be kept private? 

We will take steps to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.  [If there are special precautions this study is taking to achieve this, describe here, e.g., collecting data anonymously or coding samples immediately so they are never identified.]

We will create and collect health information about you as described in the Purpose and Procedures sections of this form.  Health information is private and is protected under federal law and Oregon law.  By agreeing to be in this study, you are giving permission (also called authorization) for us to use and disclose your health information as described in this form.

The investigators, study staff, and others at Shriners Hospital for Children may use the information we collect and create about you in order to conduct and oversee this research study [and store in a repository, conduct future research, as applicable; state if any of these are optional].

We may release this information to others outside of Shriners Hospital for Children who are involved in conducting or overseeing research, including [list as applicable]:

* The sponsor of this study, [sponsor name], and the sponsor's representatives 
* The Food and Drug Administration
* The Office for Human Research Protections, a federal agency that oversees research involving humans
* The Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health & Science University
* Other researchers, who may use your information for future research studies [only list here if other researchers may receive PHI; state if this is optional]
* [Specify others, such as NCI, NIH, coordinating centers, etc.]

We will not release information about you to others not listed above, unless required or permitted by law.  We will not use your name or your identity for publication or publicity purposes, unless we have your special permission.

For studies involving interviews, questionnaires, surveys, or other procedures during which such information may be learned, state: Under Oregon Law, suspected child or elder abuse must be reported to appropriate authorities.

If applicable, also state:  Shriners Hospitals for Children complies with Oregon state requirements for reporting certain diseases and conditions to local health departments.

State:  When we send specimens or information outside of Shriners Hospitals for Children, they may no longer be protected under federal or Oregon law.  In this case, your specimens or information could be used and re-released without your permission.

If applicable, indicate how information will be shared with other researchers (not industry sponsors) and whether shared materials will include identified information or genetic information.  Examples (modify based on your planned procedures for sample and data labeling):

[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  A code number will be assigned to you, your cells and genetic information, as well as to information about you.  Only the investigators and people involved in the conduct of the study will be authorized to link the code number to you.  Other investigators who may receive samples of your [blood/tissue/genetic information/medical information] for research will be given only the code number which will not identify you.
