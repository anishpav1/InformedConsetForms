PARENT PERMISSION FOR CHILD TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY
Title of Study
[If applicable, designate sub-group after study title, e.g., "Parents"]

Introduction

My name is __________.  I am a [student/ professor] in the Department [or School] of __________ at the University of California, Berkeley.  I am doing a research study [or if student:  I am working with my faculty advisor, Professor __________, on a research study].  We invite your child, with your permission, to participate (be a "subject") in this study.

Before you and your child decide whether he/she will be part of this study, it’s important for all of you to understand why we’re doing the research and what’s involved.  Please read this form carefully. (Your child will receive his/her own assent form.) We encourage you to discuss the study with your child. If you or your child has questions about the research, feel free to ask us.

Purpose
[Give brief explanation of why study is being done, using one or two sentences written in clear language understandable to the target population. Include reason why the child is being invited to participate. Note that study is not part of school work, e.g.:]

We are doing this study to find out more about how materials using animation on the computer can help middle and high-school aged students learn math. We are inviting your child to participate because he/she is in this age range and the school has agreed that we can conduct the research here. This study is not part of your child’s school work and it will not be graded.

[Optional: About ___ (state total number of subjects planned) children at ___ different schools in the Bay Area will take part in this study.]

Procedures
List all study procedures/activities in chronological order, using bulleted format. Indicate location where procedures will take place (e.g., in classroom or other setting), and amount of time for each procedure. Also note total amount of time required for study participation. See examples below.]

If your child decides to participate and you give permission, we will ask him/her to:

• Answer a questionnaire 

Your child will be asked to complete a questionnaire on the computer about math and the way that he/she studies for math classes].  This part will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

Your child can take a short break before the next part if he/she wants to.

• Play a computer game

We’ll load a computer game for your child to play.  The game has some math problems to think about and answer.  This part will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

• Be interviewed (Possible) 

A random sample of the students who agree to be in the study will be selected using a computer program.  We will ask these students to also participate in an interview with me or one of our researchers.

If your child is randomly selected and wants to be interviewed, and you agree, one of the researchers will meet with him/her.  This will be at a place that you decide is convenient (for example, in a private room at school or at your home after school).  

We will ask your child questions about the way he/she studies and learns, and take notes on our discussion. With your and your child's permission, we will also audiotape the interview. The taping is to accurately record the information he/she provides. If your child chooses not to be audiotaped, we will only take notes. If he/she agrees to being audiotaped but feels uncomfortable at any time during the interview, we can turn off the tape recorder, or stop the interview at his/her request at any time. 

The interview will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

• Let us videotape in his/her math class

If you and your child agree, we will videotape during your child's regular math class once or twice a week for 3 weeks. We won't interrupt the class.

Total time:  The questionnaire and computer game will take about ___ [minutes/hours] of your child's time.  If your child also has an interview, the whole study will take about ___ [minutes/ hours].  The videotaping will be done during your child's regular math class, so it won't take any extra time. 

[Study location:  Note where study procedures will take place if not already specified above.]

Alternatives
[Include this section if research intervention occurs during regular school hours. In such cases, an alternate, supervised activity (taking the same amount of time and approximate effort) must be available for children who do not wish to participate in the study, or when parental permission is not given. The alternate activity should be worked out ahead of time with the classroom teacher.  This should be conveyed in the form, e.g.:]

If you do not give permission for your child to take part in the study, or if he/she does not wish to participate, your child’s teacher will give him/her a different activity to work on for the parts of the study during school hours. [Insert brief description of alternate activity.]  It will take about the same amount of time as the research activity.

Benefits
[Explain possible benefits of the study, both direct/individual (if there are no direct benefits, make this clear), and indirect/general benefits to society or scientific knowledge, e.g.:]

There is no benefit to you or your child personally for taking part in this study.  However, we hope that the results of the research will [help improve ways of learning math on a computer for students in the future].

Risks/Discomforts
[List possible risks/discomforts, using bulleted format. See examples below.]

• Your child might get bored or tired and decide that he or she does not want to complete the study activities. If so, your child can just tell us that he or she wishes to stop. 

• Breach of Confidentiality: A possible risk for any research is that confidentiality could be compromised, that is, people outside the study might get hold of confidential study information.  We will do everything we can to minimize this risk.

Confidentiality
[This section should follow guidance under "Confidentiality" in the CPHS Template Consent Form – Social Behavioral Study. For example:]

We will keep your child's study data as confidential as possible.  If we publish or present results of this study, we will not use individual names or other personally identifiable information.

To help protect confidentiality, we will... [Explain security measures to be taken for data, samples, recordings, etc.—such as storage, coding, encryption, limited access to study records— in appropriate language for parent population.]

[If data/records will be destroyed, state when; if they will be retained, explain for how long and why, e.g.:]  We plan to keep this information for ___ years, in case we or other researchers want to use it later for other studies. But we will follow the same steps we just described to keep it as confidential as possible. [If photographs, audio or video recordings will be retained for future use, see sample Media Records Release Form.]

Compensation/Payment

[If no payment:] You/Your child will not be paid for being in this study. [Or if payment:] You [or, depending on the arrangement, Your child] will receive [e.g., amount of money, gift cards with their value] as a thank-you for the time and effort to take part in this study.  [Briefly explain how/when compensation will be dispersed.]

Rights

Participation in research is completely voluntary.  You have the right to decline to allow your child to participate or to withdraw your child at any point in this study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  Your child has the same rights to decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time.

Questions

You and your child can ask questions about this study at any time, now or later.  You can talk to me, another researcher on our team, or someone else at any time during the study.  You can contact me, [PI and/or student investigator's name], at 510-000-0000 or email@xxxx.xxx.  Or you can contact [other research team member's name] at 510-000-0000 or email@xxxx.xxx.
