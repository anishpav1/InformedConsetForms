WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? 
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to 
take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your 
decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your 
study doctor. 
 
You are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Your 
cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard 
treatment. Standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high-
dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant. 
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
The purposes of this study are: 
To find the highest doses of MLN8237, that can be given with irinotecan, and temozolomide without 
causing severe side effects. 
 
To find out the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 at different dose levels with irinotecan, and 
temozolomide. 
 
To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels 
 
To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide 
 
To determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the 
combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide 
 
To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you more likely 
to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide 
 
The research is being done because: 
 
Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  
 
This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan 
and temozolomide.     
 
MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the function of a 
protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been tested as a single-agent in 
children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the laboratory, MLN8237 
appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater when MLN8237 is combined 
with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.   
 
Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are approved 
for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer.  These 
drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In some patients with 
neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.   
 
Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this 
combination.  We first need to find out the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given safely together 
with irinotecan and temozolomide.  This study will be the first study to test giving MLN8237 together with 
irinotecan and temozolomide.  Once we have found out the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given 
with irinotecan and temozolomide, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how 
effective it is.   
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
Between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study.  
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received  the 
treatment  part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may 
be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the 
study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and 
to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need 
to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. 
 
Physical exam  Bone marrow tests# 
Blood tests Various scans* 
Pregnancy test  
Urine tests  
 
# Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is 
inside the bone. 
* Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. These 
may include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG or PET scans. We will recommend scans specific for your 
case and we will answer your questions about these scans 
 
During the Study   
 
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then 
you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. They are part of regular cancer care.

You will receive irinotecan into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube 
placed in a vein in your hand or arm) over 1 hour on days 1-5.  This medicine is typically given in the 
clinic.   
 
You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5.  The medicine is most commonly given 
as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the 
capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is given 1 hour before the 
irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7.  The medicine can only be given as a tablet.  
On days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an 
empty stomach.   
 
When you join the study, you will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This study will test up to four 
MLN8237 doses in groups of 3-6 patients. The starting MLN8237 dose for the first group of patients is 
about 40% lower than what is currently being given to patients receiving MLN8237 alone without bad side 
effects.  If this is tolerated without serious side effects, then the MLN8237 dose will be increased (“dose 
escalation”) in groups of 3-6 patients until serious side effects are seen. At that point, investigators will 
have found the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide 
without bad side effects.  This part of the study is called the Phase I part of the study.    
 
The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study.  The doses used are 
typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.   
After the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide has been found, 
another group of 8-20 patients will be treated with that highest dose to help determine how effective this 
combination is in treating neuroblastoma.  This part of the study is called the Phase II part of the study.   
 
You will only participate in the Phase I part of the study. 
    
Depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you 
may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of MLN8237, irinotecan, 
and temozolomide.  The first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count.  White blood 
cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an 
infection.  This type of medicine is called filgrastim or GCSF and is given once a day as a shot under the 
skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level.  This usually takes about 10 days for 
each cycle of chemotherapy.   If your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may 
need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. The second type of medicine helps to 
prevent diarrhea.  These medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during 
each cycle.  Your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day 
and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day.   
   
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad 
side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.  Although other participating patients may 
receive a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 will not change during your 
participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of 
MLN8237. 
 
When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
 
After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and 
scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you have abnormal 
organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. You doctor will tell 
you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.

Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
One of the main research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the 
blood during this treatment.  Since this is one of the main goals of the study you are required to submit 
extra blood samples in order to participate in the overall study.   
 
On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 mL, or about a teaspoon) will be 
drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can be drawn through that 
line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.   
 
On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be 
drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient.  If you have a 
central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan, 
then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein.  Your study doctor 
may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be 
drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study.  If you have a central line 
with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of 
the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you 
whether you will need some pokes or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be 
used to draw these samples.   
 
This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent to the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for 
testing. 
 
Other Research Tests in this Study 
You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is optional. 
The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record. 
These results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. You 
can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study. 
There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to 
participate in these optional studies. 
 
Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan 
One part of the research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if 
these are related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side 
effects after taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a 
person is to respond to this drug combination. These tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two 
teaspoons, 5-10 mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy.  This 
amount of blood is considered safe to donate.  The blood will be sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN 
for testing.    
 
Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors 
MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the amount 
of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts whether tumors 
respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These tests are done on stored 
neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If you agree to participate in this 
optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma 
tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The 
tissue will be sent to the University of California in San Francisco, CA.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad 
side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.   
 
After you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is 
left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect 
information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how 
you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have 
developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your 
oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals. 
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY? 
 
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final 
decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your 
best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 
 
You will participate in the Phase 1 part of the study.   A Phase I study looks at how common and serious 
side effects can be for each patient at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase I study, some patients may 
have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side effects.  
 
In this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of 
MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. Since subjects will be assigned to different doses 
of MLN8237, some subjects may receive doses that are too small to be effective while others may receive 
higher doses that may cause increased side effects.   
Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t 
know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other drugs may be 
given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache or itching). 
Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide, but it is 
always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. There is also a risk 
of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop. 
Because this combination has never been given to children before, there may be risks we do not know 
about. You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study. 
While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages. 
 
Possible side effects of MLN8237 
There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and their 
frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. It is 
expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that MLN8237 will have their 
toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few 
studies in adults that have been conducted to date. 
 
The frequency provided in the following table is approximate: 
 
Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are :

* If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely 
to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis). If this 
happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your white blood cell is very 
low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics. 
 
If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel 
tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion. 
 
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising 
or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help 
stop the bleeding. 
 
Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure, 
heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. 
 
MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. These 
drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that 
MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that while taking this 
drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness 
that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When stopping the drug, withdrawal 
symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and 
vomiting.  
 
Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink 
alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy while you are on 
this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as 
operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently 
taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl. 
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in 
this study. 
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

** Birth defects and other serious abnormalities in the unborn baby have been noted with irinotecan in 
animal studies at doses similar to or less than those used in humans. The timing and frequency of these 
effects is as yet unknown. These may include multiple birth defects and abnormalities of  bone formation, 
small size of baby at birth and increased risk of death of the unborn baby. Irinotecan is excreted in rat 
milk but this is unknown for humans. 
 
Possible side effects of G-CSF (such as Neupogen, filgrastim Or  Neulasta, Pegfilgrastim) 
 
G-CSF is not an anti-cancer medicine.  It helps the growth of white blood cells that fight infection.

1. My name is ____________________________. 
 
2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away 
after treatment. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn 
more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their 
cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet).  Irinotecan is a medicine that 
is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein 
in your hand or arm).  Temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) 
though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules.  The doctors think that giving 
these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells.   
 
3. If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen: 
  
The medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days.  You will only get the medicine 
during the first 7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to 
2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.   
 
  MLN8237: 
 You will take MLN8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle.   
Irinotecan: 
You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle. 
Temozolomide: 
You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle.  
 
Other medicines (not chemotherapy): 
You may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three  
chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines may include Neupogen (given once a  
day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood  
cells get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you may also take either  
Cefixime (once per day) or Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during  
each cycle of chemotherapy. 
 
Coming to See the Doctors: 
During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who 
are taking care of you. This is called “Follow-Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment has worked 
so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include; 
 Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often) 
 MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor) 
 Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow) 
 Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs. 
 Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in 
school, and any problems you might be having. 
 You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood 
counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts. 
 You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is 
going well.  
 To measure the amount of medicine in your blood, we will draw 9 blood samples (about 8 
teaspoons total) on day 1 and day 4 during the first cycle of your treatment. You may need to 
have a needle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm for these 
samples. If you have a central line, your doctor will be able to tell you if that can be used to 
draw these bloods. 
 
When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen 
 
4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. These are called 
“risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are: 
 You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.   
 You may feel tired. 
 You may have a bad appetite. 
 You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to 
get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or 
you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion. 
 You may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink.  If this happens, you 
may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital. 
 You may get diarrhea. 
 The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the 
treatment has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing. 
 You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later. 
 It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer. 
 
 Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may happen that 
the doctors don’t know about yet. 
 
5. Will we do everything possible to keep your information private.  
 
6. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits.” Some of the 
good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma tumor 
stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn more about this new treatment 
which could help other children with neuroblastoma. 
 
7. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We will 
also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if your 
parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.   
 
8. Being in this study is up to you.   You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may 
stop being in this study at any time. 
 
9. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you didn’t 
think of now, you can call me or ask me next time.     Study doctor’s phone number: 
__________________. 
 
10. Special study blood tests :  
There are extra special tests in this study.  These are done solely for research purposes only.  
Neither you nor your doctor will know the results. 
 
#1 One blood sample (1-2 teaspoons) is needed on day 1 of the first cycle of your treatment.

SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT:  PHASE II 
 
PHASE I/II STUDY OF MLN8237 IN COMBINATION WITH IRINOTECAN AND TEMOZOLOMIDE FOR 
PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA 
 
A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol. 
 
 
CONSENT FORM FOR PHASE II PORTION OF STUDY 
 
 
The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child. 
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? 
 
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to 
take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your 
decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your 
study doctor. 
 
You are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Your 
cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard 
treatment. Standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high-
dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant. 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 
The purposes of this study are:. 
 
To continue to look at the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 with irinotecan, and temozolomide. 
To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  
To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels.  
To determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the 
combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  
To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you more likely 
to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. 
 
The research is being done because: 
 
Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  
 
This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan 
and temozolomide.     
 
MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the function of a 
protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been tested as a single-agent in 
children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the laboratory, MLN8237 
appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater when MLN8237 is combined 
with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.   
 
Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are approved 
for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer.  These 
drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In some patients with 
neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.   
 
Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this 
combination.   
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
Between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received  the 
treatment  part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may 
be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the 
study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and 
to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need 
to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. 
 
Physical exam  Bone marrow tests# 
Blood tests Various scans* 
Pregnancy test  
Urine tests  
 
# Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is 
inside the bone. 
* Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. These 
may include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG or PET scans. We will recommend scans specific for your 
case and we will answer your questions about these scans 
 
During the Study   
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then 
you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. They are part of regular cancer care.

You will receive irinotecan into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube 
placed in a vein in your hand or arm) over 1 hour on days 1-5.  This medicine is typically given in the 
clinic.   
 
You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5.  The medicine is most commonly given 
as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the 
capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is given 1 hour before the 
irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7.  The medicine can only be given as a tablet.  
On days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an 
empty stomach.   
 
When you join the study, you will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This dose will be given to all 
patients entering this part of the study, as it was determined in the first part of the study (phase I portion) 
to be the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide without bad 
side effects.  This part of the study is called the Phase II part of the study.    
 
The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study.  The doses used are 
typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.   
    
Depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you 
may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of MLN8237, irinotecan, 
and temozolomide.  The first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count.  White blood 
cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an 
infection.  This type of medicine is called filgrastim or GCSF and is given once a day as a shot under the 
skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level.  This usually takes about 10 days for 
each cycle of chemotherapy.   If your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may 
need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. The second type of medicine helps to 
prevent diarrhea.  These medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during 
each cycle.  Your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day 
and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day.   
   
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad 
side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.  Although other participating patients may 
have received a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 will not change during your 
participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of 
MLN8237. 
 
When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
 
After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and 
scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you have abnormal 
organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. You doctor will tell 
you how often these tests and evaluations will be done. 
 
Medical Tests after the Study: 
 
Physical exam  Bone marrow tests 
Blood tests Various scans 
Urine tests   
 
A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been attached 
to the end of this consent. 
 
Optional Research Studies 
You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is optional. 
The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record. 
These results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. You 
can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study. 
There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to 
participate in these optional studies. 
 
Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One of the research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood 
during this treatment.  Participating in this portion of the study is optional for patients in this phase II part 
of the study.   
 
On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 mL, or about a teaspoon) will be 
drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can be drawn through that 
line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.   
 
On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be 
drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient.  If you have a 
central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan, 
then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein.  Your study doctor 
may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be 
drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study.  If you have a central line 
with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of 
the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you 
whether you will need some pokes or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be 
used to draw these samples.   
 
This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent to the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for 
testing. 
 
Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan 
 
Another research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if these are 
related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side effects after 
taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a person is to 
respond to this drug combination. These tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two teaspoons, 5-10 
mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy.  This amount of blood is 
considered safe to donate.  The blood will be sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for testing.    
 
Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors 
 
MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the amount 
of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts whether tumors 
respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These tests are done on stored 
neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If you agree to participate in this 
optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma 
tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The 
tissue will be sent to the University of California in San Francisco, CA.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad 
side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.   
 
After you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is 
left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect 
information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how 
you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have 
developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your 
oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals. 
 
 
 
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY? 
 
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final 
decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your 
best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 
 
You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully 
for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may 
be mild and some patients may have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side 
effects.  
 
In the first part of this study, researchers looked at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of 
MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. The dose of MLN you will receive was based on 
the experience of the first portion of the study that has already been shown to be tolerated without bad 
side effects in several children with neuroblastoma.  Your dose will not change with later courses of 
treatment, unless it needs to be decreased due to side effects.  
 
Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, 
headache or itching). Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go 
away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad 
side effects develop. Although this combination has been given to children in the first part of this study, 
there may be risks we do not know about. You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you 
have while taking part in this study. While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the 
following pages. 
 
Possible side effects of MLN8237 
There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and their 
frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. It is 
expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that MLN8237 will have their 
toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few 
studies in adults that have been conducted to date. 
 
The frequency provided in the following table is approximate: 
 
Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are :

* If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely 
to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis). If this 
happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your white blood cell is very 
low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics. 
 
If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel 
tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion. 
 
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising 
or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help 
stop the bleeding. 
 
Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure, 
heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. 
 
MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. These 
drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that 
MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that while taking this 
drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness 
that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When stopping the drug, withdrawal 
symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and 
vomiting.  
 
Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink 
alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy while you are on 
this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as 
operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently 
taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl. 
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in 
this study. 
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

** Birth defects and other serious abnormalities in the unborn baby have been noted with irinotecan in 
animal studies at doses similar to or less than those used in humans. The timing and frequency of these 
effects is as yet unknown. These may include multiple birth defects and abnormalities of  bone formation, 
small size of baby at birth and increased risk of death of the unborn baby. Irinotecan is excreted in rat 
milk but this is unknown for humans.

Certificate of Confidentiality Information 
 
NANT has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, which will help us protect 
the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information 
about subjects collected during the course of our covered studies.  The researchers involved in the studies 
cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in the study in any legal proceedings at 
the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, administrative, or legislative 
proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected 
information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her guardian requests the 
release of information in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary disclosure.  
Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, such as a DHHS 
request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the Food, Drug and 
Cosmetics Act. The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against the required reporting by hospital 
staff of information on suspected child abuse, reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of 
harm to self or others.

1. My name is ____________________________. 
 
2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away 
after treatment. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn 
more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their 
cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet).  Irinotecan is a medicine that 
is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein 
in your hand or arm).  Temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) 
though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules.  The doctors think that giving 
these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells.   
 
3.  If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen: 
  
The medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days.  You will only get the medicine 
during the first 7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to 
2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.   
 
  MLN8237: 
 You will take MLN8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle.   
Irinotecan: 
You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle. 
Temozolomide: 
You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle.  
 
Other medicines (not chemotherapy): 
You may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three  
chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines may include Neupogen (given once a  
day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood  
cells get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you may also take either  
Cefixime (once per day) or Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during  
each cycle of chemotherapy. 
 
Coming to See the Doctors: 
During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who 
are taking care of you. This is called “Follow-Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment has worked 
so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include; 
 Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often) 
 MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor) 
 Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow) 
 Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs. 
 Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in 
school, and any problems you might be having. 
 You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood 
counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts. 
 You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is 
going well.  
 
When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen 
 
4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. These are called 
“risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are: 
 You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.   
 You may feel tired. 
 You may have a bad appetite. 
 You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to 
get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or 
you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion. 
 You may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink.  If this happens, you 
may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital. 
 You may get diarrhea. 
 The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the 
treatment has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing. 
 You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later. 
 It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer. 
 
 Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may happen that 
the doctors don’t know about yet. 
 
Will we do everything possible to keep your information private.  
 
1. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits.” Some of 
the good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma 
tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn more about this new 
treatment which could help other children with neuroblastoma. 
 
2. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We 
will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if 
your parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.   
 
3. Being in this study is up to you.   You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may 
stop being in this study at any time. 
 
4. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you 
didn’t think of now, you can call me or ask me next time.  Study doctor’s phone number: 
__________________. 
 
5. Special study blood tests :  
There are extra special tests in this study.  These are done solely for research purposes only.  
Neither you nor your doctor will know the results.

treatment. 
 _________ Yes, it is okay to take an extra blood samples 
 
 _________ No, it is not okay to take an extra blood samples  
 
#2 One blood sample (1-2 teaspoons) is needed on day 1 of the first cycle of your treatment. 
 
 _________ Yes, it is okay to take an extra blood sample  
 
 _________ No, it is not okay to take an extra blood sample  
 
#3 Your stored neuroblastoma tissue sample will be used for research purposes in this study. 
 
 _________ Yes, it is okay to use my stored neuroblastoma tissue sample  
 
 _________ No, it is not okay to use my stored neuroblastoma tissue sample
