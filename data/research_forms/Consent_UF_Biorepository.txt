INFORMED CONSENT FORM
to Participate in Research, and
AUTHORIZATION 
to Collect, Use, and Disclose Protected 
Health Information (PHI)
Dr Krista Vandenborne is asking permission from you/your child,
__________________________________________________________________ 
Printed name of study participant (“study subject”)
to store some of your blood, urine, saliva samples, and any MRI/MRS data.
The Principal Investigator (the person in charge of this research) or a representative of 
the Principal Investigator will describe this tissue and data bank to you and answer all of 
your questions.  Your participation is entirely voluntary.  Before you decide whether or not 
to take part, please read the information below and ask questions about anything you do 
not understand.  If you choose not to participate in this study you will not be penalized or 
lose any benefits that you would otherwise be entitled to.
1. What are we asking to store?
If you agree, the following will be collected and stored in the tissue and data bank. We are 
requesting that blood, urine, saliva samples, and any MRI/MRS data taken as part of any 
ImagingDMD study be stored in the University of Florida Biorepository. 
2. Reason for Storing Your Tissue and data:
We wish to store your blood, urine, saliva samples and MRI/MRS data and potentially use 
it in future research. Because the nature and value of any future testing or research 
cannot be known at this time, this genetic information and any other results obtained from 
using your tissue and data may not be given to you or your doctor. 
There are many different kinds of research uses for these samples and data. Some 
researchers may develop new tests to find diseases. Others may develop new ways to 
treat or even cure diseases. In the future, some of the research may help to develop new 
products, such as tests and drugs. Some research looks at diseases that are passed on 
in families (called genetic research). Research done with your blood, urine, saliva 
samples and MRI/MRS data may look for genetic causes and signs of disease.

Many medical problems may arise due to the environment or from genetic factors. Your 
medical condition may come from one or both of these causes. Genetic factors are those 
that people are born with and that can affect other family members.  There may be 
genetic testing done in the future that would provide information about traits that were 
passed on to you from your parents or from you to your children. Because the nature and 
value of any future testing or research cannot be known at this time, this genetic 
information and any other results obtained from using your tissue and data may not be 
given to you or your doctor. 
Tests done only for research purposes will not be evaluated or used to diagnose or treat 
any of your medical problems. This/these test(s) may need to be repeated if required for 
your medical care in the future.
3. Can you change your mind?
If you decide that your tissue and data can be kept for future research but you later 
change your mind, you can contact Dr Krista Vandenborne at 352-474-0329 or contact 
the research coordinator Claudia Senesac at 352-273-6453  who will remove and destroy 
any of your tissue samples and /or MRI/MRS data that he/she still has.  Otherwise, the 
samples may be kept until they are used up, or until the University of Florida decides to 
destroy them. You have the right to see and copy the information that is collected from 
you and stored in the tissue and data bank. There will be no cost to you for any tissue or 
MRI/MRS data collected and stored.
4. Where will your <medical information \ tissue \ blood sample> be stored?
Your tissue samples and MRI/MRS data will be kept in a secure location in a 
biorepository called Imaging Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Biorepository so that it may 
be used in future research to learn more about your medical condition and other medical 
problems. Once collected, you may be called from time to time to update information on 
your health that is necessary to keep the tissue and/or data. 
5. Are there any benefits to your participation in this tissue and data bank?
There is no direct benefit for your participation in this tissue and data bank.  Even though 
the research that is done on your tissue samples and/or MRI/MRS data cannot be used to 
help you, it might help other people who have a similar medical condition or other medical 
problems.
6. Are there any risks to your participation in this tissue and databank?
There are no known risks to storing your tissue samples and MRI/MRS data in the 
Biorepository. However the risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the 
site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an 
infection; and, uncommonly faintness from the procedure. There are no known risks to 
collecting urine or saliva samples.

MRS and MRI are not known to harm living systems. Imaging is used routinely for 
medical care and is very safe for most people, but you will be monitored during the entire 
MR scan in case any problems occur.   However, the possibility of unforeseen hazards 
cannot be ruled out. The risks of MRI are:
•    The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet.  Therefore, you may not be 
able to have the MRI if you have any type of metal implanted in your body, for 
example, any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in your eyes, 
or certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips.  Someone will ask you 
questions about this before you have the MRI.
•   There is not much room inside the MRI scanner.  You may be uncomfortable if 
you do not like to be in close spaces ("claustrophobia").  During the procedure, 
you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system, and, in the 
event of an emergency, you can tell them to stop the scan
•   The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced 
hearing loss in a very small number of patients.  You will be given earplugs 
and a headphone set to reduce this risk.
Although every effort will be made to keep your information confidential, there is a small 
risk that an unauthorized person may obtain your information. Therefore, there is a very 
slight risk that a test result could be linked to your identity and inadvertently disclosed to a 
third party.  
If you were to receive the result of a genetic test that indicated a problem, it could cause 
anxiety or other psychological distress.  In addition, you might have to decide whether or 
not to discuss the findings with members of your family.  If a third party learned the 
results, there is a risk of social stigma and of the unpredicted disclosure of this 
information to others. 
There is a Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 
that makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most 
employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Additional 
information can be obtained at: http://irb.ufl.edu/gina.html or call 1-800-669-3362.  If you 
think this law has been violated, it will be up to you to pursue any compensation from 
the offending insurance company and/or employer.
7. Will your tissue and data be shared with others?
Dr Krista Vandenborne and/or other research staff directly connected with this study or 
their successors will be allowed to collect, use and/or give out your tissue samples and 
MRI/MRS data. They may give your tissue and MRI/MRS data  to other researchers 
whose research is approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) (An IRB is a group 
of people who are responsible for looking after the rights and welfare of people taking 
part in research).  They may also give your medical information \ tissue to a study 
sponsor, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the Office of Human Research Protections, or other Government agencies.

Your blood, urine, saliva samples and MRI/MRS data may be shared with other 
research centers or private companies, in which case the University of Florida may 
charge the research center or private company a fee in order to recover the University 
of Florida’s costs of sharing your tissue and/ or MRI/MRS data. There is a risk that 
information received by these authorized persons or agencies could then be passed on to 
others beyond your authorization and not covered by the law.  
8. How will the researchers benefit?
In general, presenting research results helps the career of a scientist.  Therefore, the 
Principal Investigator may benefit if the results of this study are presented at scientific 
meetings or in scientific journals. It is possible that new treatments, medicines, therapies 
or products could be created from studies that use your tissue or medical information. If 
that happens, the Principal Investigator and the University of Florida could receive 
significant financial benefits. You will not be offered any payment or any other financial 
benefit.
9. If you choose to take part in this study, will it cost you anything?
