INFORMATION ABOUT A RESEARCH STUDY
Title of Study 
[If applicable, designate sub-group after study title, e.g., "7-12 Year Olds"]


My name is __________.  I am a [student/professor] in the Department [or School] of __________ at the University of California, Berkeley.  I am doing a research study [or if student:  I am working with my teacher, Professor __________, on a research study], and I want to ask if you will be part of it.

What is a research study?

A research study is when people like me collect a lot of information about a certain thing to find out more about it.

This letter tells you about my study so you can decide if you want to be in it.  Before you decide, you can talk about it with your parents or anyone else you like.  If you have any questions about the research, just ask me.

Why are we doing this study?

I [and the other researchers on my team] am [are] doing this study to find out more about __________ [explain study purpose in brief, simple terms].

Why are we talking to you about this study?
[Give brief explanation of why the child is being asked to participate in study.]

We're asking a lot of children your age if they would like to help.  We're inviting you to be in the study because [you are __________ or you have __________].

What will happen if you are in this study?
[List all study procedures/ tests/ activities in chronological order, using bulleted format. Indicate location where procedures will take place (e.g., lab, home, or other setting), and amount of time needed for each procedure. Also note total amount of time required for study participation. See below for examples of various procedures:]

If you agree to be in this study and your parents say it's okay, we will ask you to:

* Answer questions
On the first day, you and your parents will come to our lab.  We will ask you and your parents to answer some questions about the way you think, act, and feel about things.

If you don't want to answer any of the questions, you don't have to.

This part will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

* Do tests/ puzzles/ computer games
Then we will ask you to [briefly describe study procedures/activities, e.g.] take some tests/ solve some puzzles/ play some computer games.  You will sit at a computer and read words, look at pictures, or play computer games.]

Sometimes you will have to make decisions about these words or pictures on the computer.  Or you will have to answer questions with a pencil and paper, or by speaking out loud.  We will explain exactly what you need to do and when to do it.

You can take breaks during the tests or computer games whenever you need to.

This part will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

* Blood sample:
We will ask you to give a small sample of your blood.  A person specially trained to draw blood from kids will put a needle into a vein in your arm and draw the blood into a small tube.  It will take about 10 to 15 minutes at the most. [Explain how many blood draws will be done and when they will occur.]

So on the first day, you will spend about ___ [minutes/hours] on the study.

* Brain scan
[NOTE: See CPHS Guidelines on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Research and apply to protocol and assent/permission forms as appropriate.]

On the second day, you will get a brain scan called an "MRI," which stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

-When you get an MRI, you lie down on a narrow table that's called a "scanner bed."  We slide the bed into the "scanner."  The scanner is a very big tube that is open at each end.  The scanner makes pictures of your brain.

-Before you can go into the scanner, we want to make sure it's safe.  We will ask you and your parents to read over the MRI screening form with us.  This form lists the different things that can make it unsafe for you to be in the scanner, like wearing braces, having a tattoo, or being pregnant.

	Girls only:
We don't know if an MRI scan can be bad for an unborn baby.  So if there is any chance you might be pregnant, you should not participate in this study.

	-If the screening shows it's safe for you to get an MRI, we'll go ahead to the next steps.

1.	First, we will train you in a "pretend scanner."  This lets you get used to what it's like in the real scanner.  You will see how it feels to lie down in a narrow space and practice keeping still, which is very important for the real scan.  This training will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

2. Then, after you take a rest, we'll ask you to do the real scan.  For the real scan, you will lie still on the scanner bed.  We will put cushions around the sides of your head to help keep it from moving.  Since the scanner can be very noisy, we will give you earplugs to protect your hearing.  We will make sure that you are comfortable.

3. We will slowly slide the scanner bed you are lying on into the scanner.  Once you are inside... [explain what will happen/what subject will be asked to do].

4. While you are doing these tasks, the MRI scanner will be making pictures of your brain that measure your brain activity.

5. You can take breaks from the tasks whenever you need to.  If you want to stop at any time, just say so.

6. The real MRI scan will take about ___ [minutes/hours].

So on the second day, you will spend about ___ [minutes/hours] on the study.

* Saliva (spit) collection:
We will also ask you to give samples of your saliva (spit). [Describe method for collection, e.g., spitting into a tube, and indicate how many times it will be done.] This will just take a few minutes to do each time.

Total time:  Altogether, the whole study will take about ___ [minutes/hours] of your time [spread out over ___ days.]

[Study place: Note where study procedures will take place if not already specified above.]

Will you get healthier if you are in the study? 
[Explain possible benefits of the study, both direct (individual) and indirect (general benefits to society or scientific knowledge), in simple terms, e.g.:]

No, this isn't a study about getting healthier or a treatment to make you better.  But we hope to learn more about __________, [so in the future we can help people/other children who have __________].

Will any part of the study be uncomfortable or hurt?
[List possible risks/discomforts, using bulleted format. See examples below.]

* Blood drawing:  Getting your blood drawn can hurt for a few seconds from the needle stick going in, like when you get a shot at the doctor's office.  Afterwards, you might get a little bruise.  Sometimes an infection can develop there, but that hardly ever happens.

* Brain scan:  You might be uncomfortable while you are in the MRI scanner.  This happens to some people when they lie very still in a small space.

-The scanner makes a loud noise when it is turned on.  That's why we will give you earplugs to wear while we are taking pictures of your brain.

-You might feel something like a tap on your body or a tingling while the scanner is running.  If you do, it shouldn't last very long.

If you do not like being in the scanner for any reason, please [instruct the subject how to indicate he/she is uncomfortable or wants to take a break, e.g., speak out loud/ into an intercom, squeeze a squeeze-ball, etc.], and we will stop the testing right away.

Who will know that you are in the study? (optional for this age range)
[Confidentiality should be fully covered in the parent permission form, but depending on the age and maturity of the child, the concept may not be fully understood in assent. A brief discussion should be included if the researcher believes it will be meaningful to the subjects, e.g.:]

You, your parents, and the researchers are the only ones who will know about your participation in the study.  If we write up a report about this research, we won't use any real names of people who were in it.  We will just write about what we learned from all the results put together.

Will you get paid for being in the study?

[If no payment:] You will not be paid for being in this study. [Or if payment:] Your parents [or, depending on the arrangements, You] will receive [e.g., amount of money, gift cards with their value] as a thank-you for your time and effort to take part in this study.

Do you have to be in the study?

No, you don't!  Research is something you do only if you want to.  Nothing bad will happen if you don't want to be in the study.  Just tell us.  And remember, you can always change your mind later if you don't want to be in the study any more.

Do you have any questions?

You can ask questions about this study at any time, now or later.  You can talk to me, or your parents, or someone else if you like.

You can contact me, [PI or student investigator's name], at 510-000-0000 or email@xxxx.xxx. Or you can contact [other research team member's name] at 510-000-0000 or email@xxxx.xxx.
