ASSENT TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY
ABOUT CANCER TREATMENT

For children 7-12 years old

Why are we meeting with you?

We want to tell you about something we are doing called a research study.  A research study is when doctors collect a lot of information to learn more about something.  Dr. [PI's name] and some other doctors are doing a study to learn more about children with cancer.  After we tell you about it, we will ask if you'd like to be in this study or not.

Why are we doing this study?

We want to find out how well your kind of cancer treatment is working.  So we are getting information from lots of boys and girls like you.

In the whole study, there will be about 300 children who have brain tumors.

What will happen to you if you are in this study?

Only if you agree, two things will happen:

1. A small amount of your blood will be drawn.  That means it will be taken by a needle in your arm.  This will happen every 3 months for one year.  [If some or all of blood draws would be done anyway as part of child's clinical care, emphasize here what will be done extra for the study.]

2. The doctors will do some tests on part of your brain tumor.  The part they look at will already be removed before the study begins.

Will this study hurt?

The stick from the needle to draw your blood will hurt, but the hurt will go away after awhile.  It will not hurt for the doctors to look at the part of your brain tumor that's already been removed.

Will you get better if you are in this study?

No, this study won't make you feel better or get well.  But the doctors might find out something that will help other children like you later.

Do you have any questions?

You can ask questions any time.  You can ask now.  You can ask later.  You can talk to me or you can talk to someone else.

Do you have to be in this study?

No, you don't.  No one will be mad at you if you don't want to do this.  If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.  Or if you do want to be in the study, tell us that.  And, remember, you can say yes now and change your mind later.  It's up to you.

If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.

If you want to be in this study, just tell us.
The doctor will give you a copy of this form to keep.
