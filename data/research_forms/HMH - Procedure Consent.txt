TO THE PATIENT: You have the right, as a patient, to be informed by your physician/practitioner
about your condition and the recommended surgical, medical, or diagnostic procedure to be used so
that you may make the decision whether or not to undergo the procedure after knowing the risks and
hazards involved. This disclosure is not meant to scare or alarm you; it is simply an effort to make
you better informed so you may give or withhold your consent to the procedure.

Has your physician informed you about the medical, surgical, or invasive procedure(s)
proposed for you, along with the risks, benefits, alternatives and side effects of the
procedure involved to your satisfaction? Y I N
(Pt. Initials)
1. I

voluntarily request Dr.

-------

as my physician, and such associates, technical assistants and other health care providers
as they may deem necessary, to treat my condition which has been explained to me (us) as:

2. I (we) understand that the following surgical, medical, and/or diagnostic procedures are planned for

me and I (we) voluntarily consent and authorize these procedures:

------

3. I (we) understand that the physician may require other physicians including residents to perform

important tasks based on their skill set and, in the case of residents, under the supervision of the

responsible physician. (Residents are doctors who have finished medical school but are getting more
training.)
4. I (we) understand that additional qualified medical practitioners, who are not physicians, may perform

important parts of the procedure or the administration of anesthesia. These practitioners will be

performing tasks within their scope of practice. Also, I (we) understand that it may be necessary for

a representative from a medical device company to participate in my procedure either by monitoring
the equipment or consulting with the physician.
5. I (we) understand that my physician may discover other or different conditions that require additional

or different procedures than those planned. I (we) authorize my physician and such associates,

technical assistants and other health care providers to perform such other procedures as are
advisable in their professional judgment.

and hazards, but I (we) re que�� the
.
use of anesthetics
for the relief and protection from pain during the planned and add1t1o�al
proced ures I (we) �nderstand that my anesthetic may involve the use of general anesthesia,
spinal, epidura!, reg 1�nal and/or local mechanism. I (we) realize the anesthesia may have to be
changed, possibly without explanation to me.
11. I (we) un�erstand that c�rtain complications may result from the use of general, epidural, spinal
and. f!lOnitored ane�thes1a care (MAC). These may include infection, brain damage, aryd death.
Add1t1onally, for epidural and spinal anesthesia, there is a risk of persistent back pam, nerve
da�age, headache, and bleeding/epidural hematoma. For general anesthesia and MAC, there is
a nsk of permanent organ damage, memory loss/dysfunction, and damage to vocal cords, teeth
or eyes. For epidural, spinal and MAC. there is a potential to convert to a general anesthetic if
the level of anesthesia for the procedure being done is inadequate.
.

12.

I (we) also understand that my anesthetic will be managed by one or more anesthesiology
physicians (anesthesiolo g ists). These anesthesiologists may also direct other members of my
anesthesia care team including one or more Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs).

13.

I (we) have been given an opportunity to ask questions about my condition, alternative forms of
anesthesia and treatment, risks of non-treatment, benefits, the procedures to be used, and the
risks and hazards involved, and I (we) believe that I (we) have sufficient information to give this
informed consent.
