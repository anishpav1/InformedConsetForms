TITLE:  “Genetic Determinants of Peripheral Arterial Disease” 
 
IRB #:  06-002911 00 
 
RESEARCHER: Dr. I. Kullo and colleagues 
 
PROTOCOL LAST APPROVED BY INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD: March 6, 2007 
 
THIS FORM APPROVED: March 6, 2007 
 
This is an important form.  Please read it carefully.  It tells you what you need 
to know about this research study.  If you agree to take part in this study, you 
need to sign this form.  Your signature means that you have been told about 
the study and what the risks are.  Your signature on this form also means that 
you want to take part in this study. 
 
Why is this research study being done? 
 
This study is being done to identify new genetic and biochemical markers of peripheral 
arterial disease. 
 
How many people will take part in this research study? 
 
The plan is to have 1600 patients with peripheral arterial disease take part in this study at 
Mayo Clinic Rochester. 
 
What will happen in this research study? 
 
Your participation in the present study will include: 
 
You will be requested to complete a questionnaire at the start of the study. The 
investigators will ask you to provide information about your cardiovascular history and 
risk factors for hardening of the arteries. 
 
 Page 1 of 8 
 
The investigators will collect a sample of blood (approximately four tablespoons) from a 
vein in your arm using a needle. If you are scheduled to have blood tests as part of your 
evaluation at Mayo, then at that time the extra blood for this study would be collected. 
 
The investigators plan to use your blood sample to study your inherited genetic material 
and other circulating markers that may be involved in the development of vascular 
disease.  
 
The investigators may review your medical records to examine and verify your medical 
and surgical history, past physical exams, laboratory tests and treatments. Your blood 
sample will be coded with a number rather than your name for identification purposes at 
the Mayo Clinic Rochester. This code will allow your sample to be used without anyone 
knowing that it is your sample just by looking at the label. 
 
Because the genetic tests or other biochemical tests in this study are not used for regular 
medical care, you will not be told the results of the test(s). The test results will not be put 
in your medical record either. 
 
Additional information you should know:  
 
The researcher and/or Mayo Clinic may earn money from results of this study.  
 
How long will I be in this research study? 
 
Your active participation in this study will be the time it takes to complete the 
questionnaire and have your blood drawn. Your blood sample may be stored indefinitely. 
 
Are there reasons I might leave this research study early? 
 
Taking part in this research study is your decision. You may decide to stop at any time. 
You should tell the researcher if you decide to stop and you will be advised whether any 
additional tests may need to be done for your safety. 
 
In addition, the researchers or Mayo may stop you from taking part in this study at any 
time if it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is 
stopped. 
 
Will any biological sample(s) be stored and used for research in the future? 
 
If you agree to give your sample, it will be the property of Mayo and may be used for 
research by Dr. Kullo and other staff at Mayo Clinic. Your sample of blood will be stored 
at Mayo Clinic and given a code (rather than your name) while it is stored and when it is 
used in research. This code would allow your sample to be used without anyone knowing 
 Page 2 of 8 
 
that it is your sample just by looking at the label. In addition, researchers at Mayo who 
are not involved with this study may ask to use your sample for further research.  
 
There is a very small chance that some commercial value may result from the use of your 
sample. This could include new products like a drug or a test to diagnose a disease. Other 
researchers may also pay us to use the sample s in their research. If that would happen, 
you will not be offered a share in any profits. You would not have any ownership or 
rights to the information or products that are made using the sample. 
Some future studies may be for testing the genes you inherited from your parents (also 
known as genetic testing). If a researcher finds that future test results may be useful for 
your health care, you will be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. At 
that time you will be given general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs 
of choosing to learn the test results. The risks of learning genetic test results may include 
emotional upset, insurance or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning 
unknown information about your parents or blood relatives. No test results from these 
future studies will be put into your medical record unless you choose to learn the results 
of the testing. Sometimes results should be released only through a genetic counselor 
who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this information. Signing 
this consent form shows your permission for the storage and use of your blood sample in 
future research. 
 
If you want your sample destroyed at any time, write to the Administrator of the Mayo 
Clinic Office for Human Research Protection, 201 Building 4-60, 200 First Street 
Southwest, Rochester, Minnesota 55905. Mayo has the right to end storage of the sample 
without telling you. If you move please send your new address to Mayo Clinic Rochester, 
Section of Registration, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

How do researchers from other institutions get the sample? 
 
Researchers from universities, hospitals, and other health organizations conduct research 
using tissue. They may contact Mayo and request samples for their studies and Mayo 
may send the tissue sample(s) and some information about you to researchers who 
request them, but Mayo will not send your name, address, phone number, social security 
number, or any other identifying information with the sample. If these researchers use the 
sample for future research and decide that a test result may be useful for your health care, 
they may contact the Mayo Clinic and Mayo would then contact you to offer you the 
choice to learn the test results.  Signing this consent form shows your permission to give 
your blood samples to outside researchers. 
 
What are the risks of this research study? 
 
There are no physical risks involved in this study. This study is being done to gather 
information. There may be slight discomfort involved in obtaining a blood sample from a 
vein in your arm. Occasionally a bruise can occur at the site where blood was taken. No 
other physical risks are anticipated from study participation in this proposed 
investigation. 
 
Providing names and addresses of your relatives to the investigators may be perceived by 
some family members as an invasion of privacy, and this could impact family 
relationships. 
 
In the present study, your blood will be tested for genes that you inherited from your 
parents (also known as genetic testing). No test results from this study will be put into 
your medical record unless you choose to learn the results of the testing. If the 
researchers find that the genetic test results may be useful for your health care, you will 
be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. At that time you will be given 
general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs of choosing to learn the test 
results. The risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset, insurance 
or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning unknown information about 
your parents or blood relatives. Sometimes results should be released only through a 
genetic counselor who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this 
information. 
 
A pregnancy test will not be necessary as part of this study because there is no risk to an 
unborn child in this investigation.

Are there benefits to taking part in this research study? 
 
This study may not make your health better. However, we hope that the information 
learned from this study will lead to better understanding of early onset vascular disease 
and hopefully to new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vascular 
disease. 
 
What other choices do I have if I don’t take part in this research study? 
 
This study is only being done to gather information. You may choose not to take part in 
this study. 
 
Will I need to pay for the tests and procedures? 
 
You will not need to pay for any procedures and tests which are done just for this 
research study. These procedures and tests include collection, preparation and genetic 
analysis of your blood sample. However, you and/or your health plan will need to pay for 
all other tests and procedures that you would normally have as part of your regular 
medical care. 
 
What happens if I am injured because I took part in this research study? 
 
If you have side effects from the study treatment, you need to report them to the 
researcher and your regular physician, and you will be treated as needed.  Mayo will give 
medical services for treatment for any bad side effects from taking part in this study.  
Such services will be free if not covered by a health plan or insurance.  No additional 
money will be offered.  
 
What are my rights if I take part in this research study? 
 
Taking part in this research study does not take away any other rights or benefits you 
might have if you did not take part in the study. Taking part in this study does not give 
you any special privileges. You will not be penalized in any way if you decide not to take 
part or if you stop after you start the study. Specifically, you do not have to be in this 
study to receive or continue to receive medical care from Mayo Clinic. 
 
You will be told of important new findings or any changes in the study or procedures that 
may affect you or your willingness to continue in the study. 
 
Who can answer my questions?
