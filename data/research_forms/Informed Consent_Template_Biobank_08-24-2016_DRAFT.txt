DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH 

PURPOSE:

Why this research is being done: 

• Succinctly explain the research WITHOUT medical terms or other scientific jargon. 
• Identify investigational drugs/devices.
• When applicable, add:  “This is a local/national/worldwide study with ___ locations across the city/country/world. The study will enroll a total of __ participants worldwide/nationally.  This location will enroll ___ participants. REPLACE WITH NAME of SPONSOR is paying for this study to be completed.”

Importance of biobanking for future research use and broad sharing:

Thousands of biological samples (biospecimens) and/or associated data collected from consenting study participants are usually needed for research studies in order to develop new products and processes to improve and personalize health care (e.g., treat, cure, or prevent diseases). Therefore, biospecimen(s) and/or data from an individual study participant, though very important in the research process, are not individually responsible for the development of new treatments or processes in most cases. It takes many study participants, as well as time, to carry out research studies large enough to make real changes. Having a great number of physicians, researchers, and individuals participating in research is important for collection of the large numbers of biospecimens and/or data sets needed for research aimed at preventing, treating, and curing diseases and other ill-health conditions. It often takes many years to obtain research results from large studies, and biospecimens and data are often stored (“banked”) for future research use and/or collaborative sharing. Without informed consent from study participants, their biospecimens and/or data cannot be stored for future research use or broad sharing among researchers and/or via biobanks. Thus, study participants need to be informed in an understandable language about the research study, as well as future use and data sharing, in order to make informed decisions about providing consent.

The [information and/or biospecimens] collected from consenting participants in this research study will be available for future research use and sharing (possibly indefinitely) as a resource for approved researchers at UTHealth and other affiliated or collaborating institutions, such as [Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, etc.]. It is possible that on occasion, research scientists outside of the Texas Medical Center may, after a thorough review and approval process, also be allowed to use the [biospecimens and/or information] collected for important research activities. 

If applicable, add:  We are hopeful that this study may provide new medicines, procedures, and/or therapies for the future, including interventions that will prevent and/or cure important diseases such as cancer, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Any biospecimens (such as blood, saliva, urine, other tissue samples, DNA) and associated data will be stored for use in future medical research studies. The Principal Investigator (PI) and the scientists he/she works with, and may work with in the future, will use the biospecimens and associated data for research about the cause of diseases (such as those listed above) and development of effective and safe treatment and/or prevention. 

The scientists who use this resource will not, however, have access to your personal identification information (known as protected health information or PHI, such as name, address, social security number, date of birth).

PROCEDURE: 

What to expect as a study participant: 

• Describe the procedures so that the potential study participant will know exactly what will happen and the time period. 
• Do not detail procedures conducted as part of standard treatment. Clarify how research procedures differ from standard treatment. 
• Clearly state the use of experimental drugs, devices, treatment, etc. 
• For venipunctures for blood samples indicate "you will have about [state amount in tsp., tbsp., or oz.] of blood drawn from a vein in your arm [state frequency]. The total amount of blood withdrawn during your participation will be about (state amount in tsp., tbsp., or oz.)." 
• For genetic testing and genomic studies, indicate the types of testing to be done (e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS), direct analysis of candidate genes, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and gene expression testing) and the diseases or conditions to be studied.
• Describe how study participant confidentiality will be maintained.
• State whether or not study results (individual or group) will be provided to the participants and, if so, under what circumstances and disclosure procedures.
• State how biospecimens and/or associated data will be stored and maintained for future research use and broad sharing (e.g., by the PI and/or in collaboration with a biorepository), including security measures to maintain confidentiality (describe briefly here and refer to the below “Future Research Use and Broad Sharing” section).
• Describe procedures for participant to withdraw from study, if he/she chooses, and having his/her biospecimens and/or data discarded appropriately and not available for future use and sharing (also refer to the bullet point under the below “Future Research Use and Broad Sharing” section).

• For questionnaires, if applicable, add:

You are also giving permission to allow researchers to use a questionnaire to ask you questions about [your disease and health history] [and/or demographics]. Your name or other information (PHI) that could identify you will be kept confidential. 

• For follow-up information, if applicable, add:

The PI or collaborating researcher will contact you [each year] by phone, mail, or e-mail in order to [ask questions about your health all the way through your life, or schedule a follow-up visit or one-on-one discussion]. [The PI office/institution] or collaborating researcher will obtain medical records from your physician, hospital, and from other healthcare facilities where you might be admitted in the future.] If for some reason the [PI office/institution, or collaborating researcher] cannot contact you, you are giving permission for [PI office/institution, or collaborating researcher] to contact those persons whose names you have provided to us to help locate you in the future. 

FUTURE RESEARCH USE AND BOARD SHARING[HM2]

The PI and/or the collaborating [specify biorepository name, e.g., UTHealth CCTS Biobank] will store your [biospecimens and/or associated data] in secure locations (e.g., secure databases and systems, secure data zones, secure facilities), accessible by only the PI and authorized collaborators. They may be stored indefinitely, unless you indicate at any point that you wish to withdraw your consent for future use and broad sharing. Prior to research use and sharing, all [biospecimens and associated data] will be de-identified from their source (i.e., PHI such as name, address, social security number, and date of birth will be removed and they will be assigned a study number) to maintain study participant confidentiality. The [biospecimens and/or associated data] will be used for research by the PI and potentially shared with research collaborators, but only with your permission (i.e., informed consent for future research use and broad sharing) and only after certain stipulations are met (i.e., the collaborators must have a current study protocol approved by the [specify IRB, e.g., UTHealth Institutional Review Board (IRB)], current verification of training in the protection of human subjects for research, and approval from the PI for collaborative sharing. The PI and collaborating [specify biorepository name] will only share your biospecimens and/or associated data in this controlled-access manner and will not share via unrestricted means (i.e., they will not be accessible to anyone via a public website).  

With your informed consent for future research use and broad sharing:

• Genomic and phenotypic data may be generated from your de-identified biospecimens and, along with other de-identified data obtained from you relevant to this study (e.g., demographics, clinical information such as exposure or disease status), may be used for future research on any topic and shared broadly in a manner consistent with your consent and all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

• De-identification will consist of stripping any identifiers such as name, address, social security number, date of birth, medical record or account number, and any other identification numbers or PHI by standards consistent with the “Common Rule” (U.S. Federal Policy) from biospecimens and associated data, and assigning a study number (or code) prior to research, including prior to future use and broad sharing (e.g., prior to controlled-access sharing via the PI and/or biorepository).

• Access to de-identified study participant biospecimens and associated data will be controlled (as above-mentioned) by the PI and authorized collaborators, and shared only after the above-mentioned stipulations are met.

• There is a possibility that, even though access to data will be controlled and data security standards will be maintained, at some point it may be possible to re-identify de-identified genomic data and, therefore, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. Re-identification of data could potentially be used in a negative manner (e.g., relative to the study participants, their family, or associated individuals). There may be unknown risks regarding confidentiality. 

• Direct benefits to study participants from secondary, future research use should not be expected.

• You may withdraw your consent for future research use and broad sharing of your biospecimens and associated data at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. In such an event, biospecimens and/or associated data will be withdrawn from the PI and/or the collaborating biorepository, if possible, and disposed in a manner which complies with federal, state, and local regulations. However, any de-identified biospecimens and associated data already disseminated in reports or publications or distributed for research use and broad sharing will not be retrieved. 

• The name and contact information of the PI and/or biorepository collaborator and/or research collaborator who is familiar with the research and biorepository will be available to address participant questions.


TIME COMMITMENT:

How much time we ask of you: 

• Give the amount of time which the subject will be asked to devote to the study, including any follow-up. 
• Contrast the time requirement with that required for standard care, if applicable. 


BENEFITS: 

Possible benefits to you: 

• Describe potential benefits to the study participant and to society in general. If drugs, laboratory examinations, or other procedures are provided free to the subject, indicate whether these will be available when the study ends. 

• ** HOWEVER ** Do NOT put the free provision of these drugs, laboratory examinations, or other procedures to the participant in this "Benefits" sections; that information belongs in the "Cost, Reimbursement, and Compensation" section. Only indicate if the drugs, laboratory examinations, or other procedures will still be available to the subject after the end of the study. 

• Or, indicate: “You should not expect to receive any personal benefit from being in this study. Your biospecimens and those of other participants may produce information that can be used to help others in the future.”

• Or, indicate: "You may receive no direct benefit from being in this study; however, taking part may help individuals get improved health care in the future". 


WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH USING MY [BIOSPECIMENS AND/OR DATA]?

You [nor your doctor] will [not] be given reports or other information related to the results of the research that uses your [biospecimens and/or data]. [These reports will not be put in your health record. This is because the research tests are not performed to clinical standards. Also, research can take a long time and must use biospecimens and data from many individuals before results can be known. These results may not be available for many years.] The results of this study may, however, be disseminated in a report or publication, in which you will not be identified.

RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS: 

Possible risks, discomforts, or inconveniences to you are: 

• Explain only the risks, discomforts, or inconveniences derived from the research itself. List possible physical, psychological, legal, or social risks or possible risks from loss of confidentiality that may arise from taking part in the study. 

• When applicable, state that: “The particular treatment or procedure might involve risks to the participant which are currently unforeseeable.” 

• When applicable, state that: “If the participant was or became pregnant, the particular treatment or procedure might involve risks to the embryo or fetus, which were currently unforeseeable.” Also state that: “If the subject were to become pregnant during the study, she should contact the investigator immediately.”

When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would reveal your identity.  

• If photographs, videos, or audiotape recordings will be used, explain how the subject’s identity will be protected or disguised. Describe the subject's right to review/edit tapes, who will have access, and when they will be erased.
• If there is a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study, delete any template language that refers to releasing data or participant information “required by law.” 

As mentioned above, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. Re-identification of data may be possible at some point in the future and could potentially be used by individuals outside of the research study in a negative manner (e.g., relative to the study participants, their family, or associated individuals). There may be unknown risks regarding confidentiality. 

When applicable:

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 is an act of the U.S. Congress that protects against the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment issues. Other federal and state laws and rules also provide protection. GINA makes it illegal for most health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers to discriminate based on genetic information. The law includes these protections:

• Insurers generally may not request genetic data about you or your family. (The results of genetic tests may apply not only to the patient or research participant but also to their family members.)
• Insurers may not use your genetic data when setting eligibility or premiums.
• Employers may not request or use genetic data for: hiring, promotions, or firing people. They also may not use the information when setting terms of employment. 
• GINA does NOT apply to companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. It also does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. Although GINA offers no protection in these cases, state laws do in some cases.] 

ALTERNATIVES: 

Alternatives to being in the research study:

You may select options other than being in this research study. They are [list alternatives]. Dr. [PI's name] will discuss these alternatives with you.  

If no other alternative is available [The only alternative is not to take part in this study.]

STUDY WITHDRAWAL: 

How you may stop taking part in the research study: 

• Describe the circumstances under which the investigator may stop a participant's involvement without regard to the participant's wishes, e.g., evidence of drug allergy, inability of participant to maintain appointments, noncompliance with protocol, evidence of potential danger to subject.

• If an immediate halt to the research may cause injury, explain the consequences and procedures for participant withdrawal. 

You have the right to withdraw from the research study at any time. If you want to withdraw from the study, call the PI or collaborating researcher at [phone number] to let us know.
