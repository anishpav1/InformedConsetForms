FOR RESEARCH THAT INCLUDES CREATION OF CELL LINES OR PLURIPOTENT CELLS

FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND/OR GO TO THE HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH INFORMED CONSENT TEMPLATE ON THE JHM IRB WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION REQUIRED IN THE CONSENT FORM. 

Section 2: Why is this research being done?


Your child’s tissue sample may be used to create a living tissue sample (called a “cell line”) that 	can be grown in the laboratory.  This allows researchers to have an unlimited supply of your child’s cells in the future without asking for more samples from your child.



We may use the cells taken from your child’s [specify source of cells, e.g. skin] to create a type of cell known as a pluripotent cell.  This type of cell can be used to create different types of tissue, including [specify type of cells, e.g. cardiac, muscle, etc.] cells.  Your child’s cells might be used in research involving genetic alteration of the cells.



Your child’s cells will (if known)/might (if unknown) be mixed with other human cells, mixed with animal cells, or grown in lab animals like mice.

What you should know about the cell lines that will be derived in the course of this study?
• The cell lines created will be similar or identical to your child genetically.
• The cell lines may be kept indefinitely.
• There is the possibility that your child’s cells or the created cell lines might be used in research that will involve genetic manipulation of the cells or the mixing of human and non-human cells in animal models.
• The cell lines may be shared with researchers both inside and outside of Johns Hopkins, including our commercial partners.
• The cell lines may be used to develop treatments for a variety of diseases and conditions.

Section 3: What will happen if you allow your child to join this study?




Common Consent Form Errors

• Do not use “treatment” or “therapy” to describe an investigational drug, device or procedure. For investigational drugs use words like, “study drug” or “study product.” For an investigational device, use words like “study device” or “study product.”  For an investigational procedure, use “study procedure” or “research procedure.” 
   
• For investigational drugs or devices, state they are investigational and describe that term (e.g., the word "investigational" means the study drug is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is still being tested in research studies. Be consistent in using “investigational” throughout the consent form. Do not describe investigational drugs, devices or procedures as “new.” The word "medication" or "medicine" should only be used if the drug is commercially available for that particular condition.

• Do not use the term "treatment” or “therapy”" if one of the study arms will use a placebo.  Clarify for the participant by using “study drug or placebo,” or “study product,” or “study substance.” Do not refer to a placebo as medicine or medication.

• Use "study doctor" (more understandable to a lay person) instead of “principal investigator." 

• Use "research study," instead of "trial." 

• Use the word "participant" in the consent form instead of “patient” since this is research.  However, you may use “patient” when referring to the person prior to his/her entering the study.

• Do not use the word “invite” (for example, “You are invited to participate in a research study.”)  Instead use, “You are being asked to participate in a research study because (insert condition here).”

• When describing randomization for 2 groups use, “like the flip of a coin,” for more than 2 groups, use "like drawing numbers from a hat." 

• Do not use e.g. or etc., use instead, "for example," "so forth."

• Spell out acronyms when first used.

• Do not use all capital letters (CAPS) or bold items unnecessarily.

• Use initial lines or check boxes for optional portions of the study (e.g., asking permission to store samples for future research).

• For double-blind studies, include a statement that the blind can be broken in case of an emergency. Example: “In the case of an emergency, the study doctor can quickly find out to what study group your child is assigned.”

2. Why is this research being done?


       
This research is being done to....


The use of “X” (study drug or device name) in this research study is investigational. The word “investigational” means that “X” is not approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA is allowing the use of “X” in this study.



“X” (drug or device name) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ___ (include disease name).  It is not approved for use in ___ (disease name).  The FDA is allowing the use of _”X” in this research study.





Children with ______ may join. 

How many children will be in this study?





3. What will happen if you allow your child to join this study?

If you agree to allow your child to be in this study, we will ask you to allow your child to do the following things:


	











The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) may help protect you and your child from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information.  
      
      The law provides that health insurance companies and group health plans 
• may not ask for genetic information from this research and 
• may not use genetic information when making decision about eligibility or premiums

The law will not stop health insurance companies from using genetic information to decide whether to pay claims.  The law does not apply to other types of insurance (such as: life, disability or long-term care). 



      Request to collect and store biospecimens for future research  

As part of this research study, we would like to ask you to let us store your child’s biospecimens and health information for future research.  This research could include other diseases and involve research tools such as gene sequencing or the creation of cell lines. 

• Gene sequencing of your child’s DNA provides researchers with the code to your child’s genetic material.  
• Cell lines are living tissue samples that can be grown in a laboratory.  A cell line can provide an unlimited supply of cells in the future without requiring more samples from your child.  Each cell contains your child’s complete DNA.

The study doctor can provide you with additional information if you have questions.  Also, further information about our use of your child’s biospecimens can be found in this consent document under the heading “What happens to Data and Biospecimens that are collected in the study.”

      Will you allow us to store the biospecimens we collect for this study for use in future research?
YES E    ________________________                                        
                Signature of Parent                                                        

NO O    __________________                             
                Signature of Parent                                                        



How long will your child be in the study?
 

Your child will be in this study for ____

4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?
















Your child may get tired or bored when we are asking her/him questions. Your child may find it tiring or boring if s/he is asked to complete questionnaires. Your child does not have to answer any question s/he does not want to answer.




Despite the GINA protections and the best efforts of the research team, there may still be a risk if information about you or your child were to become known to people outside of this study.



Genetic information is unique to your child, even without your child’s name or other identifiers. For this reason, genetic information like DNA may be used to identify your child and possibly your family members.  We have procedures (such as, labeling your child’s biospecimens with a password protected code known only to select research staff) to prevent people working with your child’s DNA from discovering if it belongs to your child. However, there is the risk this can happen as new ways of tracing genetic information are being developed that may make re-identification of genetic information possible.



There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known. 


5. Are there risks related to pregnancy?



      This research may hurt an embryo or fetus in ways we do not currently know. 

6. Are there benefits to your child from being in the study?


There is no direct benefit to your child from being in this study. 


If your child takes part in this study, your child may help others in the future.




7. What are your options if you do not want your child to be in the study?




If you decide not to allow your child to join this study, other options are available.  You do not have to allow your child to join this study to get treatment.  Other treatments include (describe treatments)



You do not have to allow your child to join this study.  If your child does not take part in the study, your child’s care at Johns Hopkins will not be affected

8. Will it cost you anything to allow your child to be in this study?  






You will receive a separate Insurance and Research Participant Financial Responsibility Information Sheet (Sheet). 

This Sheet will give you the following information:
• The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that are part of this research and that will be paid for by the study (no cost to you).  

• The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that will be billed to you and/or your health insurer.  If you have health insurance, you will be responsible for any co-pays or deductibles not covered by your insurance. 




9. Will you or your child be paid if you allow your child to join this study?


You may be required to provide your social security number to be paid for taking part in this study. Federal tax law requires that you report your research payments when you file your taxes. If your total payments from Johns Hopkins exceed $600 per year, Johns Hopkins will report these payments to the Internal Revenue Service and you will receive a 1099-MISC form from us.

10. Can your child leave the study early?
      
• You can agree to allow your child to be in the study now and change your mind later.
• If you wish to end your child’s participation, please tell us right away.
• Leaving this study early will not stop your child from getting regular medical care. 
• If your child leaves the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give out your child’s health information that it already has, if the information is needed for this study or any follow-up activities.



11. Why might we take your child out of the study early? 



Your child may be taken out of the study if:
• Staying in the study would be harmful.
• Your child needs treatment not allowed in the study.
• You or your child fails to follow instructions.
• Your child becomes pregnant.
• The study is cancelled.
• There may be other reasons to take your child out of the study that we do not know at this time. 
• If your child is taken out of the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give out your child’s health information that it already has if the information is needed for this study or any follow-up activities.



12. How will your child’s privacy be protected?






We have rules to protect information about your child.  Federal and state laws and the federal medical Privacy Rule also protect your child’s privacy.  By signing this form you provide your permission, called your “authorization,” for the use and disclosure of information protected by the Privacy Rule.

The research team working on the study will collect information about your child.  This includes things learned from the procedures described in this consent form.  They may also collect other information including your child’s name, address, date of birth, and information from your child’s medical records. This could include information about HIV and genetic testing, or treatment for drug or alcohol abuse or mental health problems.

The research team will know your child’s identity and that your child is in the research study.  Other people at Johns Hopkins, particularly your doctors, may also see or give out your child’s information. We make this information available to your child’s doctors for your child’s safety.   

People outside of Johns Hopkins may need to see or receive your child’s information for this study.  Examples include government agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration), safety monitors, other sites in the study and companies that sponsor the study.

We cannot do this study without your authorization to use and give out your child’s information.  You do not have to give us this authorization.  If you do not, then you may not join this study.

We will use and disclose your child’s information only as described in this form and in our Notice of Privacy Practices; however, people outside Johns Hopkins who receive your child’s information may not be covered by this promise or by the federal Privacy Rule.  We try to make sure that everyone who needs to see your child’s information keeps it confidential – but we cannot guarantee that your information will not be re-disclosed.

The use and disclosure of your child’s information has no time limit. You may revoke (cancel) your permission to use and disclose your child’s information at any time by notifying the Principal Investigator of this study by phone or in writing.  If you contact the Principal Investigator by phone, you must follow-up with a written request that includes the study number and your contact information.  The Principal Investigator’s name, address, phone and fax information are on page one of this consent form. 

If you do cancel your authorization to use and disclose your child’s information, your child’s part in this study will end and no further information about your child will be collected. Your revocation (cancellation) would not affect information already collected in the study, or information we disclosed before you wrote to the Principal Investigator to cancel your authorization.


13. Will the study require any of your other health care providers to share your child’s health information with the researchers of this study?

      
As a part of this study, the researchers may ask to see your child’s health care records from her/his other health care providers.  

• Optional: You will be asked to give us a list of other health care providers that your child uses. 

14. What if there is a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study? 


Insert appropriate agency has given us a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study.  This Certificate adds special protection for research information that identifies you or your child and allows us, in some circumstances, to refuse to give out information that could identify you or your child as a research subject without your consent, when such information is sought in a federal, state, or local court or public agency action. Still, we may disclose identifying information about you or your child if, for example, your child needs medical help.

We may also disclose identifiable information about you or your child as described in Section 12 of this form or in other cases. For example, the government may see you or your child’s information if it audits us, and the research team will voluntarily comply with local disclosure laws and will tell the local or state authorities:

• If they suspect abuse, neglect or abandonment of a child or vulnerable or dependent adult;
• If certain diseases are present; and
• If the team learns that you or your child plans to harm someone. In this case, the team also may warn the person who is at risk.

This Certificate does not mean the government approves or disapproves of this research project.

15. What does a conflict of interest mean to the participants in this study? 

A researcher has a financial or other interest in this study. 


In some situations, the results of this study may lead to a financial gain for the researcher and/or Johns Hopkins.  This financial interest has been reviewed in keeping with Johns Hopkins’ policies.  It has been approved with certain conditions, which are intended to guard against bias and to protect participants.

If you have any questions about this financial interest, please talk to name and telephone number of non-financially interested designee. This person is a member of the study team, but does not have a financial interest related to the study. You may also call the Office of Policy Coordination (410-516-5560) for more information. The Office of Policy Coordination reviews financial interests of investigators and/or Johns Hopkins.

16. What treatment costs will be paid if your child is injured in this study? 



Johns Hopkins does not have a program to pay you if your child is hurt or has other bad results from being in the study.  However, medical care at Johns Hopkins is open to your child as it is to all sick or injured people. 



• If you have health insurance:  The costs for any treatment or hospital care your child receives as the result of a study-related injury will be billed to your health insurer. Any costs that are not paid for by your health insurer will be billed to you.

Johns Hopkins and our research partners work to understand and cure diseases.  The biospecimens and/or data you provide are important to this effort.
	
If you allow your child to join this study, you should understand that you/your child will not own your child’s biospecimens or data, and should researchers use them to create a new product or idea, you/your child will not benefit financially. 



With appropriate protections for privacy, Johns Hopkins may share your child’s biospecimens and information with our research sponsors and partners.   

18. Assent Statement


This research study has been explained to my child in my presence in language my child can understand.  He/she has been encouraged to ask questions about the study now and at any time in the future.







19. What is a Genome-Wide Association Study?
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) look at the genetic differences that exist in the entire human genome (the complete set of human genes) and the association between these differences and health conditions.  

As part of this study, we will be collecting information about your child’s health and your child’s individual genes. This information will be sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) GWAS database called dbGAP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). 

The aim of collecting this information is to look for genetic connections that:
• may make people more likely to get a certain disease (such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, heart disease or mental illness) or a condition (such as high blood pressure or obesity)
• may affect the progress of a certain disease or condition
• may affect treatments (medicines, etc.) that work for certain diseases in some people, but not in others. 

We will remove direct identifiers and code your child’s information before sending it to the NIH. NIH will never get this code or the identifiers we have removed. 

Johns Hopkins will not know what types of research will be done with the data that are sent to the database.  

GWAS data will be shared with other researchers world-wide through the dbGaP Database.  This database is kept at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the NIH. 

Researchers must apply to NIH to use the dbGaP database.  Special review committees will look at these applications to decide whether or not to share the data.  Researchers must agree to keep data safe and use the data only for the purpose approved by the NIH.

What are the risks of data being stored for GWAS?					
There may be risks to your and your child’s privacy and the privacy of your relatives from storing your information in a GWAS database.

Although we believe that the NIH privacy measures make this unlikely, there is a risk that your child’s identity could become re-connected with your child’s genetic and health information.  

If this happened -
• Information could be revealed that could lead to denial of employment or insurance for you, your child or a relative, or 
• Law enforcement agencies might be able to demand information about your child in connection with an investigation.

Are there benefits to being in a GWAS study?
There is no direct benefit to your child from GWAS research.  The information from your child’s data may lead to a better understanding of how genes affect health.  This may help other people in the future.

We have rules to protect information about your child.  Federal and state laws and the federal medical Privacy Rule also protect your child’s privacy.  By signing this form you provide your permission, called your “authorization,” for the use and disclosure of information protected by the Privacy Rule.

The research team working on the study will collect information about your child.  This includes things learned from the procedures described in this consent form.  They may also collect other information including your child’s name, address, date of birth, and information from your child’s medical records. This could include information about HIV and genetic testing, or treatment for drug or alcohol abuse or mental health problems.

The research team will know your child’s identity and that your child is in the research study.  Other people at Johns Hopkins, particularly your doctors, may also see or give out your child’s information. We make this information available to your child’s doctors for your child’s safety.   

People outside of Johns Hopkins may need to see or receive your child’s information for this study.  Examples include government agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration), safety monitors, other sites in the study and companies that sponsor the study.

We cannot do this study without your authorization to use and give out your child’s information.  You do not have to give us this authorization.  If you do not, then you may not join this study.

We will use and disclose your child’s information only as described in this form and in our Notice of Privacy Practices; however, people outside Johns Hopkins who receive your child’s information may not be covered by this promise or by the federal Privacy Rule.  We try to make sure that everyone who needs to see your child’s information keeps it confidential – but we cannot guarantee that your information will not be re-disclosed.

The use and disclosure of your child’s information has no time limit. You may revoke (cancel) your permission to use and disclose your child’s information at any time by notifying the Principal Investigator of this study by phone or in writing.  If you contact the Principal Investigator by phone, you must follow-up with a written request that includes the study number and your contact information.  The Principal Investigator’s name, address, phone and fax information are on page one of this consent form. 

If you do cancel your authorization to use and disclose your child’s information, your child’s part in this study will end and no further information about your child will be collected. Your revocation (cancellation) would not affect information already collected in the study, or information we disclosed before you wrote to the Principal Investigator to cancel your authorization.
