Dear Parents/ Guardians:
We are delighted to inform you about the vaccination collaboration between The Pulaski County Health
Department (PCHD) and Pulaski County Public Schools. Immunization rates have dropped in our country and
in Pulaski County. We often hear that parents find it difficult to arrange for children to receive immunizations
with a physician or local health department. Because we believe in prevention and community service, we will
offer the influenza (Flu) vaccine to all our students this year. Immunizations will be given on October 19th, 20th,
21th, and 25th.
“Flu” is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs. It is
spread mainly from person to person by droplets that are released in the air when an infected person coughs or
sneezes.
There will be no charge to parents of children who choose to receive the flu vaccine; however, Pulaski Health
Department will collect your insurance information and bill for the cost of the vaccine. Any cost not covered by
your insurance will not be billed to parents.
In order to provide vaccination to your child, you will need to complete, sign, and return the attached Student
Flu Vaccination Consent form to your child’s school nurse by September 29, 2016. Please complete and
sign the Consent Form. In addition, you will want to read the Influenza (flu) Vaccine Information Statement.
If a completed and signed consent form is not returned to the school, your child will not be given the
vaccination.
You are under no obligation to participate. This is simply a service to parents of our students to alleviate the
hardship associated with trying to schedule a doctor’s visit, securing transportation, and potentially missing
work in order to get your child’s flu vaccination. When more people get vaccinated against the flu, less flu
illness can spread throughout our community.
Please remember that your child does not have to participate in this vaccination opportunity and it does not
eliminate the need for your child to receive regular check-ups with your health care provider.

Sincerely,

Kevin W. Siers, Ed.D.
Division Superintendent
