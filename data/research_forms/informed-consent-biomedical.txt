Exclusion Requirements 
You cannot participate in this study if you [Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list of exclusion criteria - use lay language] Example: are taking high blood pressure medications. 


HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY GO ON?
Short-term/simple study:  This study includes [XX visits] and takes about [XX hours] over a period of [XX days/weeks]. 

Long-term/complex study:  You will take [specify drugs or interventions] for [months, weeks/until a certain event].  After you are finished taking [drugs or interventions], the researchers will ask you to visit the office for follow-up exams for at least [indicate time frames and requirements of follow-up.  When appropriate, state that the study will involve long-term follow-up and specify time frames and requirements of long-term follow-up.]  For example, "The researchers would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life.  They would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing.  Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition every year helps them look at the long-term effects of the study.


WHAT PROCEDURES ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY?
Before you can participate in the main part of the study...
You will need to have "screening" exams, tests or procedures.  The screening process helps the researchers decide if you meet the study requirements listed below.  The screening procedures include [Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list - use lay language]

During the main part of the study...
If the screening exams, tests and/or procedures show that you can continue to be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will have the following procedures and tests done. The main study tests and procedures include...
1. [Explain the research procedures in chronological order -, main study procedures, and follow-up procedures. Include the expected duration of each procedure, or each visit and the procedures to be completed at the visit.  Use lay language.
2. Procedures do not necessarily need to include specific names of standard lab tests (e.g., CBC, CMP, lipid panel, UA), but participants should know the type of specimen required for testing and the general purpose of the testing (e.g., "A blood sample will be taken from your arm to perform standard lab testing to make sure you do not have a low red blood cell count.")
3. Procedures do not necessarily need to include specific names of common psychological tests (e.g., BDI-II, MMSE, MCMI-III, MACI, QOLI), but participants should know the general purpose of the testing and how long the testing will take (e.g., "A standard test will be used to measure how you are feeling and your current level of depression. The test should take about 30 minutes to complete.") 
4. Specify the amounts of blood or tissue to be taken for study purposes using a lay equivalent (e.g., tablespoon, teaspoon). 
5. Include medical record review as a study procedure when protected health information is created, accessed or disclosed for the study. 
6. It is strongly recommended that you provide a table of visits, tests and procedures. Tables may be easier for the subject to understand and may help to shorten long repeated paragraphs throughout the consent document.
7. For studies that involve routine (standard of care) medical procedures:
Make clear in the consent form whether procedures are being done for clinical reasons or for study purposes, including whether the procedures are being done more often because of the study. Use the following guidelines to determine the extent to which standard procedures and their associated risks need to be described in consent forms: 
a. If the standard procedure is not explicitly required by the study protocol, the consent form need not describe that procedure or its risks. 
b. If the standard procedure is a main focus of the study (e.g., one or more arms of a randomized study is standard) or is explicitly required by the study protocol, the consent form must include a full description of the procedure and its risks.]

After you complete the main part of the study [stop receiving [drugs or interventions]...
[Explain the follow-up tests, procedures, exams, etc. required, including the timing of each and how they relate to standard care (e.g., they are different from standard care; or they are part of standard care but are being performed more often than usual or being tested for the study. Define the length of follow-up. [If not applicable, please remove.]


WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OR RISKS RELATED TO THE STUDY?
[When applicable, include a sub-heading to indicate risks associated with the investigational drug, device or procedure, and then provide another sub-heading to indicate risks related to other procedures involved with the study.]
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, researchers don't know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious.  The researchers may give you medicines to help lessen side effects.  Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking [drugs/interventions].  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  [The next sentence should be included if appropriate: There is also a risk of death.]
You should talk to the research team about any side effects you experience while taking part in the study.
Risks and side effects related to the [procedures, drugs, interventions, and devices] include those which are:
[Categorize the risks by likelihood and severity of the risk occurring. Use percentages if known.   Consider all types of risks - psychological, social, economic, legal and physical.  Also include risks such as a breach of confidentiality and those risks related to the use of placebo.  For risks related to radiation exposure, all protocols involving radiation exposure to normal subjects, and/or to clinical subjects when the exposure is not considered standard-of-care, must be referred to the UCI Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) for review.]

[If appropriate to the study, include the following risk statement(s)- remove or revise as applicable]

Randomization:  You will be assigned to a study group by chance (like a coin flip) rather than by a medical decision made by the researchers. The treatment you receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study group(s), or than standard treatments available for your condition.  

Washout period: During this study the medication you normally use for your condition will/may be stopped for up to [XX days/weeks/months]. You will/may receive no medication, or medication at a dose which may not help your condition. As a result, you will/may have an increase in symptoms including XX.

Placebo:  During this study there is a XX chance that you will receive a placebo. This could lengthen the amount of time before you receive a treatment that may be effective. During this time you may experience worsening of your condition, including increased symptoms such as XX. The researchers will carefully monitor your condition. If your symptoms worsen and make you uncomfortable, you can withdraw from the study.

Blood draw:  Removing blood by a needle may cause temporary pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling, dizziness, and on rare instances fainting or infection. 

Exercise testing: The exercise test may cause muscle soreness, dizziness, or shortness of breath. In rare instances, exercise tests may cause chest pain, tightness, or a change in vital signs. 

Psychological discomforts: Some of the procedures may cause embarrassment or anxiety, or the questions the researchers ask you may be upsetting or make you uncomfortable.  If you do not wish to answer a question, you can skip it and go to the next question.  If you do not wish to participate you can stop.

HIV testing:  Being tested for HIV may make you feel nervous or anxious about the test results.  A positive test indicates that you have been infected with the HIV virus, but no one knows for certain when, if ever, you will become sick with AIDS or a related condition.  Receiving positive results may make you very upset.  If other people learn about your positive test results, you may have trouble obtaining insurance or employment. To the extent permitted by law, the researchers will keep your test results confidential and will not release them to anyone without your written permission. If you test positive, California law requires health care providers and clinical laboratories to report the HIV test results with your personal identifying information to the local health department.

MRI: The MRI procedure uses a powerful magnetic field to generate detailed images of the body. The magnet could move objects within your body that contain metal, such as implants, clips and pacemakers. Tell the doctor if you have any metal items within your body. 

MRI scanning is painless but you might experience discomfort in the machine. You may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia when placed inside the MRI, or by lying in one position for a long time. In addition, loud noises occur during the study when the scanner is collecting measurements. These noises are beeping and hammering sounds and may bother you. Temporary hearing loss has been reported from this loud noise.  This is why you will be asked to wear ear plugs. 

Radiation: [For additional examples of radiation language for total dose of more than 1 rem see the last page of the consent form.]

[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is less than 1 rem].

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.  A [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA or CT scan] scan uses radiation to create pictures of the structures inside the body.  The total radiation dose that you will receive from [insert total number of scans] scan(s) of this type is about [insert total effective dose (e.g., 20 millirem)].  A millirem is a unit used to quantify radiation dose.  Typically persons in the U.S. receive a radiation dose of about 310 millirem per year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water and soils.  Therefore your total radiation dose will be about the same as [XX] extra [insert number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.    

There is no known health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure, and no radiation remains in the body after the scan.  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.  

[Insert if Iodinated contrast used during CT scans]
"Iodine-containing contrast "dye" will be injected into your vein.  This increases the ability of the CT scan to show certain tissues in the body.  Side effects may include a mild headache, nausea, or burning at the injection site. Some people are allergic to the contrast, experiencing hives and itchy eyes, or very rarely, a bee-sting type of severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). Use of iodine contrast may also cause an injury to the kidneys that is usually reversible, but can be more severe if you have kidney disease or diabetes. Before you are given this dye, please share any history you have of allergies, asthma, diabetes, heart disease or kidney disease."

[Insert if Gadolinium contrast used during MRI scans]
Gadolinium contrast "dye" will be injected into your vein.  This increases the ability of the MRI scan to show certain tissues in the brain or elsewhere in the body.  Side effects include a mild headache, nausea, or burning at the injection site. Some people are allergic to gadolinium, experiencing hives and itchy eyes, or very rarely, a bee-sting type of severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). Use of gadolinium may be linked to a rare but sometimes fatal condition (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis or NSF) in people with severe chronic kidney disease or acute kidney problems. Therefore, before you are given this dye your risk factors for kidney disease will be reviewed.

[Use language for a nuclear medicine scan if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is less than 1 rem.]

During this study you will have [XX] [insert number and type of scan; e.g., bone scan, thyroid scan, PET scan including body part to be imaged]  using a radioactive drug to produce an image of your [insert body part to be imaged].  The drug is injected [insert route of administration; e.g., it may be ingested] in your body, and then after [XX] hours [insert time based on specific nuclear medicine protocol], you will have a scan of your [insert actual body part; e.g., your whole body, thyroid, or heart] using a "gamma camera" that detects the radiation inside you, and creates a picture of structures inside your body.  This scan is solely for the purpose of this research, and you would not have this scan if you decide not to participate in this research study.  The total radiation dose you will receive from one scan is about 0.1 rem [put in actual total effective dose].  For comparison, persons in the United States receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem every year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water, and soils, so the radiation exposure from one scan is equivalent to about four extra months [put in actual number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.

After the scan, you will still have some radioactivity retained in the body, which will go completely away in the following [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan].  The risk to others is very low, but you may cause sensitive radiation detectors used for security to alarm in the [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan] after the scan.  There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  If you are especially concerned with radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the study doctor. 

[Insert for scans (e.g., MRI, X-ray, CT)]
Incidental finding: There is a risk of an unexpected finding from your [specify type of scan].  The results will be shared with you and if necessary, you will be referred to your primary care physician or other specialist for additional consultation.

Unknown risks: [Required if this research is a medical intervention, or a clinical investigation with investigational drug, biological product or device; or risk profile of research intervention is not well known]
There may be risks related to the research that we don't know about yet.  However, you will be informed of any additional risks to which you may be exposed, and any changes that are made to the study, as a result of any newly-identified risks. 

Reproductive Risks: [Required if the study intervention could harm unborn baby.  All of the following statements in this section may be modified as applicable.]
You should not get pregnant while in this study. The [specify: experimental procedure, investigational treatment, experimental drug] used in this study could harm an unborn baby. Check with the researchers about what types of birth control, or pregnancy prevention, to use while in this study.

You should also not breastfeed a baby while in this study, as the [specify: experimental procedure, investigational treatment, experimental drug] used in this study could harm a newborn baby.

If you are a male, you should not father a baby while on this study.  

If you or your partner does become pregnant during the study, you should contact the researchers immediately.  

Pregnancy Testing in Minors 
[Required if the form is to obtain parental permission and the study includes pregnancy testing in minors.]
If your child is a female and has had her menses (her period) she will have some of her [specify: blood and / or urine] collected at different times in the study for the purposes of pregnancy testing.  Per California Law, pregnancy test results will be provided to you only with permission from your child.


ARE THERE BENEFITS TO PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY?
Participant Benefits
[If possible benefit to the subject is anticipated] Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While researchers hope [procedures/ drugs/ interventions/ devices] will be [more effective/have fewer side effects] than the standard (usual) treatment, there is no proof of this yet.

[If subject is randomized:]  If you are in the group that receives [XXX] and it proves to treat your condition [more effectively/with fewer side effects than standard therapy/placebo], you may benefit from participating in the study, but this cannot be guaranteed

[If no direct benefit to the subject is anticipated]  You will not directly benefit from participation in this study.

Benefits to Others or Society
[Insert a statement about possible benefits to science or society here] Example: a decrease in the number of children injured in car accidents
This study will help researchers learn more about [procedures/ drugs/ interventions/ devices], and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment of future patients with [. . . /conditions like yours].


WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE? 
If you decide not to participate, or if you withdraw from this study before it is completed, your other choices may include:

ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY? 
[If the considerations listed below are not applicable, please remove this heading]

[Required if the study involves collection of specimens]
Use of Specimens 
[If specimens will be discarded] 
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for routine labs will be discarded or destroyed once they have been used for the purposes described in this consent.

 [If specimens will be retained by UCI]
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for this study will become the property of the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  Once you provide the specimens you may not have access to them.  Use of the specimens could result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial products or other products that may be developed from the use of your specimens.

[If specimens will be provided to an outside entity, such as the study sponsor]
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for the purposes of this study will be provided to the Sponsor of this study [, sponsor name optional]. Once you provide the specimens you may not have access to them. Use of the specimens could result in discoveries that could become the basis for new products or therapeutic agents. In some instances, these discoveries may be of potential commercial value. You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from such a product. 

Genetics [Required if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information]
[Standard Template] In the event of an unexpected breach of confidentiality, a federal law called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) will help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information obtained about you. In California, state law (CalGINA) requires that employers with 5 or more employees may not use your genetic information, obtained from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. However, these laws do not protect you against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. 

If you would like more information about the federal GINA law go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf or CalGINA: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0551-0600/sb_559_bill_20110906_chaptered.pdf

[Alternative language for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] In the event of an unexpected breach of confidentiality, a federal law called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) will help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information obtained about you. In California, state law (CalGINA) requires that employers with 5 or more employees may not use your genetic information, obtained from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. 
  
GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  
  
If you would like more information about the federal GINA law go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf or CalGINA: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0551-0600/sb_559_bill_20110906_chaptered.pdf


Investigator Financial Conflict of Interest [Required if there could be the appearance of a conflict of interest. If not applicable, please remove. If a study team member has a disclosable financial interest the UCI Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee will develop specific language detailing the disclosable financial interest]  

OR 

No one on the study team has a disclosable financial interest related to this research project.

Request for Donation of Specimens and/or Data for Future Use [Required when subjects are asked to donate leftover biospecimens or collecting additional biospecimens. Specify how the donated biospecimens will be used. It is STRONGLY recommended that a tiered consent process be used if the researcher is able to track the levels of consent for each participant.  Refer to NCI Best Practices Bio specimen Resources manual for more information: http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/global/pdfs/NCI_Best_Practices_060507.pdf] Examples - Keep all statements that apply to this study and remove/revise as applicable.

ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES OF RADIATION RISK LANGUAGE:

[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is between 1 - 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.  A [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA or CT scan] scan uses radiation to create pictures of the structures inside the body.  The total radiation dose that you will receive from [insert total number of scans] scan(s) of this type is about [XX] rem [insert total effective dose (e.g., 2 rem)].  A rem is a unit used to quantify radiation dose.  Typically, persons in the U.S. receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem per year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water and soils. Therefore your total radiation dose will be about the same as [XX] extra [insert number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.    

There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure, and no radiation remains in the body after the scan.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.  

[Use language for x-ray, DXA, or CT scans (i.e., machine-produced radiation) if the total dose to one individual (across entire study) is greater than 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [insert total number of scans across the entire study] [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA, or CT] scans of your [insert name of body part(s) to be imaged].  These scans are [or "this scan is," as appropriate] solely for the purpose of this research and you would not have these scan(s) if you decide not to participate in this research study.  A [insert type of scan; e.g., x-ray, DXA or CT scan] uses radiation to create pictures of the structures inside the body.  The total radiation dose that you will receive from [insert total number of scans] scan(s) of this type is about [XX] rem [insert total effective dose].  A rem is a unit used to quantify radiation dose.  Typically, persons in the U.S. receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem every year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water and soils.  Therefore your total radiation dose will be about the same as [XX] extra [insert number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.    

There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure, and no radiation remains in the body after the scan.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  The average adult in the United States has about a 42% lifetime risk of having cancer (that is, about 42 out of 100 people will have cancer in their life).  An exposure of [XX] rem [insert total effective dose], may increase that risk to about XX% [insert increased risk].  If you are especially concerned about radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the researcher listed at the top of this form.  


[Use language for a nuclear medicine scan if total dose to one individual (across entire study) is between 1 and 5 rem.]

During this study you will have [XX] [insert number and type of scan; e.g., bone scan, thyroid scan, PET scan including body part to be imaged]  using a radioactive drug to produce an image of your [insert body part to be imaged].  The drug is injected [insert route of administration; e.g., it may be ingested] in your body, and then after [XX] hours [insert time based on specific nuclear medicine protocol], you will have a scan of your [insert actual body part; e.g., your whole body, thyroid, or heart] using a "gamma camera" that detects the radiation inside you, and creates a picture of structures inside your body.  This scan is solely for the purpose of this research, and you would not have this scan if you decide not to participate in this research study.  The total radiation dose you will receive from one scan is about [XX] rem [insert total effective dose].  For comparison, persons in the United States receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem every year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water, and soils, so the radiation exposure from one scan is equivalent to about [XX]  extra [insert actual number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.

After the scan, you will still have some radioactivity retained in the body, which will go completely away in the following 24 - 48 hours [insert time based on isotope and scan].  The risk to others is very low, but you may cause sensitive radiation detectors used for security to alarm in the first [XX] hours [insert time based on isotope and scan] after the scan.  There is no known short-term health effects associated with this amount of radiation exposure.  The primary risk from radiation exposure at this level is the potential for a very small increased risk of future cancer.  If you are especially concerned with radiation exposure, you should discuss this with the study doctor.

The total radiation dose you will receive from one scan is about [XX] rem [put in actual total effective dose].  For comparison, persons in the United States receive a radiation dose of about 0.31 rem every year from natural sources of radiation, including from the sun, air, water, and soils, so the radiation exposure from one scan is equivalent to about [XX] extra [insert actual number of equivalent days, months or years] of natural background radiation.
