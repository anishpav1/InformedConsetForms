Instead, use study drug, study procedures, study processes, etc.
If you will be using an investigational procedure, such as an investigational surgical procedure or innovative diagnostic procedure, please clearly identify it as investigational.


HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately ___ people will take part in this study at ___ (if multicenter, add number of hospitals/medical facilities) different hospitals and medical facilities, and approximately ____ people will take part at Duke.

WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form.  You will have the following tests and procedures to make sure that you are eligible: 
• Physical exam and medical history
• Vital signs
• Blood tests
• Electrocardiogram (EKG), a tracing of the electrical activity of the heart

Also describe in this section the procedures, study drug, samples, questionnaires, follow-up, etc, (whatever is applicable to your study).

For randomized studies: You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either (arm 1 or arm 2).  You have a ( ) in ( ) chance of receiving study drug. For studies with more than 2 arms, use “like drawing numbers from a hat.”

When describing what is involved in the study, consider laying out a timeline.  For example, on Day 1, you will have an EKG and two tablespoons of blood will be drawn from your arm by needlestick for blood tests.  On Day 2, you will receive the study drug intravenously (into your vein) for two hours (and so forth).  You can also create a timeline using visits.  For example, on Visit 1, you will receive study drug to take daily until Visit 2.  

Please note: If your study will use a placebo, please define placebo.  For example, “A placebo is an inactive substance given in the same form as the active drug, Paclitaxel.”

Be sure to disclose:
• The identification of any procedures that are investigational/experimental. (May be omitted if there are none.)
• A statement that notes the possibility that the Food and Drug Administration may inspect the records. (May be omitted for research that is not FDA-regulated.)
