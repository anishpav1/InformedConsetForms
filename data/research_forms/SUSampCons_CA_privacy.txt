If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify (name) at (telephone number).  

#This research study is looking for (state number of people) with (disease or condition).  Clarify if enrollment will occur throughout the United States or internationally.  Stanford University expects to enroll (state number) research study participants. 

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION 

*Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.  Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled.

DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT 

This research study is expected to take approximately (x days, weeks, months, etc.) e.g., this is a 2 year study; 28 days of active participation by each participant; and 180 days collection of medical information for each participant.
* If there is a washout period, explain this in lay terms, including the length of time.
* If there is a follow-up period, state so and the expected length of time.



PROCEDURES

If you choose to participate,  the Protocol Director and (his/her) research study staff will (describe all procedures to be followed).  Consider inserting a chart or calendar; these images can be very helpful to participants.  Chronological descriptions are also helpful.  Use lay terminology throughout. 

Include the following, as applicable, in this section of the consent:
* (Clearly identify what is experimental in this study.)
* (State the purpose(s) of the procedures.)  Suggestion:  refer to your protocol to assist you in identifying all protocol-related procedures.
* (State how often each procedure will be done and how long it is expected to take.)
* (Identify invasive procedures, where applicable.)
* If contraception is recommended:  (include specifics for both women AND men). 
* For labs: (state what specimens will be obtained and the estimated amount) The total amount should be calculated and presented to the participant in lay terms, e.g., the number of tablespoons of blood drawn.
* If samples will be sent out of Stanford for analysis, include a statement:  *Your samples will be sent outside of Stanford for analysis.
* If samples could be part of, or lead to the development of a commercially valuable product, include the following:  
*Any of your samples which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries. In some instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the Investigators, Stanford University and/or others.  However, donors of samples do not retain any property rights to the materials.  Therefore, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.

* If samples, such as tissues or blood, will not be saved at the end of the study add the following:   
*Any samples left over when the study is completed will not be saved for future research. 
* If samples will be saved for future research 
   see Tissue Sampling for Research.   

Use the following subsections below if applicable to your study:
* MRI
* Women of Childbearing Potential
* Tissue banking for research
* Genetic testing (current study or future research)
* Gene transfer

If your protocol uses MRI, insert the following MRI paragraphs, as applicable.
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
MRI machines use a strong magnet and radiofrequency magnetic fields to make images of the body interior.  The scanning procedure is very much like an X-ray or CT scan.  You will be asked to lie on a long narrow couch for a certain amount of time (state how long) while the machine gathers data.  During this time you will not be exposed to x-rays, but rather a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency magnetic fields, which you will not feel.  You will, however, hear repetitive tapping noises that arise from the Magnetic Resonance scanner.  We will provide earplugs or headphones that you will be required to wear.  The space within the large magnet in which you lie is somewhat confined, although we have taken many steps to relieve the "claustrophobic" feeling.

Risks:
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI machine.  However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract some metals and affect some electronic devices.  If you have a cardiac pacemaker or any other biomedical device in or on your body, it is very important that you tell the operator/investigator immediately.  As metallic objects may experience a strong attraction to the magnet, it is also very important that you notify the operator of any metal objects (especially surgical clips), devices, or implants that are in or on your body before entering the magnet room.  All such objects must be removed (if possible) before entering the magnet room.  In some cases, having those devices means you should not have an MRI scan performed.  In addition, watches and credit cards should also be removed as these could be damaged.  You will be provided a way to secure these items.  If you have any history of head or eye injury involving metal fragments, if you have ever worked in a metal shop, or if you could be pregnant, you should notify the operator/investigator.

If the study uses parameters that might exceed FDA guidelines for dB/dt and result in peripheral nerve stimulation - please check with your MR facility - add the following:  
There is a possibility that you will experience a localized twitching sensation due to the magnetic field changes during the scan.  This is expected and should not be painful. 
If the study will use contrast media, insert the following:  If you have had a previous reaction to Gadolinium-based contrast agents or a history of severe allergies, please notify the operator/investigator. If you have kidney problems, please tell the operator.

If you might use any radio frequency coil, device, or software that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration - please check with your Magnetic Resonance facility - add the following:
Some of the radio frequency imaging coils, imaging software and devices being used in your scan are not approved by the FDA but are similar to counterparts that have been approved by the FDA.  There is a small risk of heating from the cables associated with these devices.  Please report any heating sensation immediately.  
If you are operating at 3.0T or above, include the following statement: 
Dizziness or nausea may occur if you move your head rapidly within the magnet.

IF YOU FEEL DISCOMFORT AT ANY TIME, NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AND YOU CAN DISCONTINUE THE EXAM AT ANY TIME.

The following language is recommended for studies performed at the Lucas Center.  Others might consider similar language if the scan is not a diagnostic study:
The scans performed in this study are for specific research purposes and are not optimized to find medical abnormalities.  The investigators for this project may not be trained to perform medical diagnosis.  The investigators and Stanford are not responsible for failure to find existing abnormalities with these MRI scans.  However, on occasion the investigator may notice a finding on an MRI scan that seems abnormal.  When this occurs, a physician will be consulted as to whether the findings merit further investigation, in which case the investigator will contact you and your primary care physician and inform you of the finding.  The decision as to whether to proceed with further examination or treatment lies solely with you and your physician.  The investigators, the consulting physician, and Stanford are not responsible for any examination or treatment that you undertake based on these findings.  Because the images collected in this study may not comprise a proper clinical MRI scan, these images will not be made available for diagnostic purposes.

The following language is recommended when women of childbearing potential (non-pregnant) will be enrolled in an investigational study:
Women of Childbearing Potential
If you are a woman who is able to become pregnant, it is expected that you will use an effective method of birth control to prevent exposing a fetus to a potentially dangerous agent with unknown risk.  If you are pregnant or currently breast feeding, you may not participate in this study.  You understand that if you are pregnant, if you become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding during this study, you or your child may be exposed to an unknown risk (or state specific risk).


To confirm to the extent medically possible that you are not pregnant, you agree 
choose to have a pregnancy test done before beginning this research study  
or        to begin the study after the onset of your next menstrual period.  
You must agree to avoid sexual intercourse or use a birth control method judged to be effective by the investigator and which will not interfere with the proposed investigation.  You must accept the risk that pregnancy could still result despite the responsible use of reliable method of birth control.  You agree to notify the investigator as soon as possible of any failure of proper use of your birth control method, or if you become pregnant, either of which may result in your being withdrawn from the study.

If there are risks associated with men fathering a child, add appropriate language.  [e.g., If you are a man participating in this study and your partner is able to become pregnant, you and your partner must use adequate contraception while you are participating in the study and for at least [insert time after last dose of study drug, e.g., 12 weeks after taking your last dose of study medication.]  Your doctor will discuss with you what methods of birth control are considered adequate.  You should inform your study doctor if your partner becomes pregnant.]

The following language is recommended when samples of tissues, cells, blood, or body fluids (hereafter referred to as tissues) will be taken or banked for use in current or future research.  This includes testing the sample for purposes of collecting genetic or other information.  Investigators should choose the appropriate provisions to be included in their informed consent form and may vary any of the following language as appropriate.

Tissue Sampling for Research 
Research using tissues is an important way to try to understand human disease.  You have been given this information because the investigators want to include your tissues in a research project and because they want to save the samples for future research.  There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues to be studied.  
Your tissues will be stored (insert how samples will be stored - and if appropriate how samples will be linked) e.g., under diagnosis and medical record or code number and unlinked.   
If linked: You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be studied now or saved for future study.  You may withdraw from this study at any time.  The investigators might retain the identified samples, e.g., as part of your routine clinical care, but not for additional research. 

If unlinked: Because your samples will not be linked to your name after they are stored, you cannot withdraw your consent to the use of the samples after they are taken.  
 
Optional:
The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests. 
Or 
You will be told the results of tests that are part of your clinical care, but you will not be told the results of the research tests, including any future research tests. 


	_____ I consent to my samples being saved for future research

	_____ I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research

Include the following language if samples in study will be used for genetic testing or if future research on samples will include genetic testing.

Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing

As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators (may/will) do genetic testing.  Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment.  Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results.  Possible risks of knowing results include:  anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination.  A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. 

Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. 

If investigators will not share the research results with the participant, the following language can be added: 
The results of the study of your samples from this project will be used for research purposes only, and you will not be told the results of the tests. 

If investigators will allow participants to choose whether they want to receive test results and/or will contact participants in the future, the following language (two choices of language) can be added: 
Regarding informing you of the test results, you should understand the following: 
* The information may be too limited to give you particular details or consequences; 
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated;
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment; 
* You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene.  
Please circle [ yes or no ] as to whether you wish to be told the test results.
Please circle [ yes or no ] as to whether you wish your family members to be told the test results.
Or 
Investigators in this study may try to re-contact you in the future.  If you are re-contacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your tissue samples, you should understand the following: 
* The information may be too limited to give you particular details or consequences; 
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated;
* You may be determined to carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment; 
* You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene.  
If the protocol involves gene transfer the following two paragraphs must be included:

(The approximate number of people who have previously received the genetic material under the study.)

Gene Transfer Studies
To obtain vital information about the safety and effectiveness of gene transfer, at the time of death, no matter what the cause, permission for an autopsy will be requested of your family.  Please advise your family of this request and of its scientific and medical importance.  Neither you nor your family will be liable for any costs associated with the autopsy procedure.
