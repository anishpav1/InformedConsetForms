OPTIONAL FORMAT to use when there are BOTH adults and children in the same study; otherwise remove this box.
When there are both adults and children in the same study, you may use one consent form for both the adult participants and for the parents or guardians granting permission for a participant who is a minor.  If you choose to use this format, please insert the information below into your consent form.

Please check one of the following:

*FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY, CONTACT: (Protocol Director Name, address and phone number).   Only protocol directors or academic sponsors whose names appear on application cover page may be listed here.
 DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study on (describe project in non-technical language; include types of questions that will be asked, if applicable; explain purpose of the research).  You will be asked to (describe procedures; answer questions, take a survey, mention video/audio taping, if applicable, and what will become of tapes after use, e.g., shown at scientific meetings; describe the final disposition of the tapes).
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
MRI machines use a strong magnet and radiofrequency magnetic fields to make images of the body interior.  The scanning procedure is very much like an X-ray or CT scan.  You will be asked to lie on a long narrow couch for a certain amount of time (state how long) while the machine gathers data.  During this time you will not be exposed to x-rays, but rather a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency magnetic fields, which you will not feel.  You will, however, hear repetitive tapping noises that arise from the Magnetic Resonance scanner.  We will provide earplugs or headphones that you will be required to wear.  The space within the large magnet in which you lie is somewhat confined, although we have taken many steps to relieve the "claustrophobic" feeling.

Risks:
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI machine.  However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract some metals and affect some electronic devices.  If you have a cardiac pacemaker or any other biomedical device in or on your body, it is very important that you tell the operator/investigator immediately.  As metallic objects may experience a strong attraction to the magnet, it is also very important that you notify the operator of any metal objects (especially surgical clips), devices, or implants that are in or on your body before entering the magnet room.  All such objects must be removed (if possible) before entering the magnet room.  In some cases, having those devices means you should not have an MRI scan performed.  In addition, watches and credit cards should also be removed as these could be damaged.  You will be provided a way to secure these items.  If you have any history of head or eye injury involving metal fragments, if you have ever worked in a metal shop, or if you could be pregnant, you should notify the operator/investigator.

If the study uses parameters that might exceed FDA guidelines for dB/dt and result in peripheral nerve stimulation - please check with your MR facility - add the following:  
There is a possibility that you will experience a localized twitching sensation due to the magnetic field changes during the scan.  This is expected and should not be painful. 
If the study will use contrast media, insert the following:  If you have had a previous reaction to Gadolinium-based contrast agents or a history of severe allergies, please notify the operator/investigator.  If you have kidney problems, please tell the operator.

If you might use any radio frequency coil, device, or software that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration - please check with your Magnetic Resonance facility - add the following:
Some of the radio frequency imaging coils, imaging software and devices being used in your scan are not approved by the FDA but are similar to counterparts that have been approved by the FDA.  There is a small risk of heating from the cables associated with these devices.  Please report any heating sensation immediately.  

If you are operating at 3.0T or above, include the following statement: 
Dizziness or nausea may occur if you move your head rapidly within the magnet.
DDIF YOU FEEL DISCOMFORT AT ANY TIME, NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AND YOU CAN DISCONTINUE THE EXAM AT ANY TIME
TRISKS AND BENEFITS: #The risks associated with this study are (describe foreseeable risks or discomfort to subjects; if none, state as such).  The benefits which may reasonably be expected to result from this study are (describe any benefits; if none, state as such).   We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  
If applicable:   Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment/medical care.
/TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation in this experiment will take approximately (amount of time).
.PAYMENTS: You will receive (describe reimbursement; where there is none, state as such) as payment for your participation. 
If participants will be paid, add the following:
IPayments may only be made to U.S. citizens, legal resident aliens, and those who have a work eligible visa.
 
 PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
