Why is this study being done? [A6]

The goal of this study is to ... 

We also want to find out if [name of study drug] is safe to take without causing too many side effects.

[Name of study drug/device] is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This means that [name of study drug/device] can only be used in research studies.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved [name of study drug/device] to treat [FDA-approved indications for use], but the FDA has not approved [name of study drug/device] to treat [medical condition being studied].

[Name of study drug/device] is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat [medical condition being studied].[A7]

Why am I being asked to participate?[A8] 

You are being asked to participate in this study because you...

How many people will take part in the research study?

You will be one of about ## people who will be participating in this study.  [if applicable:The study will be conducted at approximately ## locations outside of Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine/North Bronx Health Network.]

How long will I take part in this research?

It will take you about [duration of participation] to complete this research study.  During this time, we will ask you to make [number] study visits to [Montefiore Medical Center/other locations].

What will happen if I participate in the study?[A9]  

The Screening Visit will take about [how long].  During this visit, we will do some tests and procedures to see if you eligible to take part in this research study.  The study doctor will review the results of these tests and procedures.  If you aren't eligible, the study doctor will tell you why.  At this visit we will: [see example below]
* Ask you about your medical history
* Give you a physical exam, including height, weight, and "vital signs" (blood pressure, temperature, heart and breathing rates)
* Draw a blood sample
* Ask you for a urine sample
* Test your urine for certain drugs
* Test your [blood/urine] for pregnancy, if you are a female able to become pregnant.  Pregnant women cannot take part in this research study.
* Take a chest X-ray
Give you some questionnaires to fill out about [your general health and well-being, quality of life, mental health, emotional health, mood, and memory][A10]

If you are eligible for the study, we will ask you to stop taking your [current medications] for the next [how long].  This "washout period" allows your regular medications to leave your body before you begin taking the study drug.  Without your regular medications, your [medical condition or symptoms] may get worse.  If this happens, please call the study doctor at the number provided in this consent form.[A11]

If you are eligible for the study, we will assign you by chance (like a coin toss) to the [name of study drug] group or the [placebo/name of comparator drug] group.  You and the study doctor cannot choose your study group.  You will have [an equal chance/a 1 in 3 chance/a 2 in 3 chance] of being assigned to the [name of study drug] group.[A12]

This research study will compare [name of study drug] to placebo.  The placebo looks exactly like [name of study drug], but contains no drugs.  During this study you may get a placebo instead of [name of study drug].  Placebos are used in research studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or due to other reasons.[A13]

Visit [number] will take about [how long].  At this visit we will:
* Check your vital signs
* Ask you about side effects or health problems since your last visit
* Draw a blood sample
* Ask you for a urine sample
* Give you some questionnaires to fill out
* Review your study drug diary
* Collect any unused study drug
* Give you a new supply of study drug[A14]

To obtain the blood sample, we will wipe the skin on your arm with alcohol to clean it. Then, we will insert a small needle into a vein [INSERT NUMBER OF TUBES] tubes[s] of blood will be drawn, about [TRANSLATE INTO TEASPOONS OR TABLESPOONS].[A15][A16]

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a test that uses magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body. For an MRI test, the area of the body being studied is placed inside a machine that contains a strong magnet. Pictures from an MRI scan are saved and stored on a computer for more study. Although the MRI you will have in this study is being done for research purposes only, it is possible that doctors may notice something that could be important to your health. If so, we will contact you to explain what was seen and tell you whether you should consult your doctor. We will make the MRI report available to your doctor, and if you want, we will talk with your private physician or refer you to someone for follow-up.[A17] 

A description of this clinical trial will be available on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S.
law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will
include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.[A18]

Will there be testing for HIV?

Yes, HIV testing will be done during this research study. The following is important information about HIV, HIV testing, and your test results:
* HIV causes AIDS and can be spread through sexual activity, sharing needles, by pregnant women to their fetuses, and through breastfeeding infants. 
* There is treatment for HIV that can help you stay healthy.
* People with HIV or AIDS should adopt practices to protect people in their lives from becoming infected with HIV.
* HIV testing is voluntary and can be done anonymously at a public testing center. However, testing is required if you would like to be in this research study. 
* The law protects the confidentiality of HIV related test results.
* The law prohibits discrimination based on your HIV status and services are available to address any discrimination. 
* If as a result of participation in this study you are INITIALLY diagnosed with HIV, the results must be reported to the New York State Department of Health for contact tracing purposes.
* If as a result of participation in this study you are diagnosed with HIV, you will be given HIV counseling or a referral for HIV counseling.[A19]

Will there be audio and/or video recording?[A20]


Genetic Testing[A21] 
NOYES[A22]This study will not involve genetic research or genetic testing. [However, DNA extracted from [specify, e.g., blood cells] will be stored for future research studies.][A23]

Genes are made up of DNA, and have the information needed to build and operate the human body. Your blood or tissue will be tested for genetic changes that may relate to [an increased or decreased risk of developing a disease, an increased chance of disability, etc.] in you or your offspring. [State the specific test(s) to be done.] The information obtained from these tests will include genetic information about you. To protect your identity, we will give your specimen(s) a code number. Genetic factors are inherited and run in families. Since genetic information is shared by family members, the information from these tests may apply to your family members, as well.

If there is a positive test result, you may want to have additional independent testing and consult with a genetic counselor. Genetic counseling is not provided through the study. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) may protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information.  The law says that health insurance companies and group health plans may not ask for genetic information from this research and may not use genetic information when making decision about eligibility or premiums

The law will not stop health insurance companies from using genetic information to decide whether to pay claims. The law will not help you get other types of insurance (such as: life, disability or long-term care) and these insurance companies sometimes use information from genetic testing to deny life insurance or disability coverage to applicants. [A24]

The meaning of the results of this genetic research is not known; therefore we will not give you the results of these studies. You should be aware that insurance companies sometimes use information from genetic testing to deny life insurance or disability coverage to applicants. If you decide to participate in this research study, if your insurance company asks, you should state that you have not had a genetic test. [A25]
Specimen Banking (Future Use and Storage[A26])

Are there any risks to me?[A44] 

Confidentiality
We will keep your information confidential, however, a risk of taking part in this study is that your confidential information might be shared accidentally with someone who is not on the study team and is not supposed to see or know about your information. This is very unlikely, because the study team takes confidentiality of your information seriously. Your research records will be kept confidential and your name will not be used in any written or verbal reports. Your information will be given a code number and separated from your name or any other information that could identify you. The form that links your name to the code number will be kept in a locked file cabinet and only the investigator and study staff will have access to the file. All information will be kept in a secure manner and computer records will be password protected. Your study information [if relevant: and specimens] will be kept as long as they are useful for this research.

The only people who can see your research records are:
* the research team and staff who work with them
* the organization that funded the research
* organizations and institutions involved in this research: [LIST][A45]
* groups that review research (the Einstein IRB, and the Office for Human Research Protections, [if relevant: and the US Food and Drug Administration])

These people who receive your health information, may not be required by privacy laws to protect it and may share your information with others without your permission, if permitted by laws governing them.  All of these groups have been asked to keep your information confidential.[A46]

Are there any times you would not keep my data confidential? 
If you give us information that suggests that your child or any other child is being abused, we are required by law to report that information to the Administration for Children's Services (ACS). Reporting this information may put you, your family, or others who are involved at risk of questioning and legal action by the authorities. 

If you give us information that you may hurt yourself [insert language describing conditions user which you may break confidentiality].

If you give us information that you may hurt someone else, we [insert language describing conditions under which you may break confidentiality and whether you will report this information to the authorities]. [A47]

Certificate of Confidentiality
As a way to protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health, which is funding this study.  If information from this study was requested or subpoenaed by government agencies or the courts, we will use the Certificate to legally refuse to provide it.  This is rare - in only a few cases did researchers have to use the Certificate, and it was honored most of the time, but not every time. There are several kinds of situations that the Certificate does not apply. For example, we are still required to report child abuse and some diseases, and we must make data available to the government for a review or evaluation of our research. The Certificate does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily sharing information. Similarly, if an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.
[A48]
Blood Draw
Rarely, the vein where we inserted the needle will become sore or red. Sometimes, a temporary harmless "black and blue" may develop. Very rarely, fainting may occur. [A49]

MRI
Some people are bothered by feelings of confinement (claustrophobia), and by the noise made by the machine during the test. You will be asked to wear earplugs or earphones while in the machine. You may not participate in this study if you have a pacemaker, an implanted defibrillator or certain other implanted electronic or metallic devices. It is important for you to tell the MRI staff if you have had brain surgery for a cerebral aneurysm, or if you have implanted medical or metallic devices, shrapnel or other metal, such as metal in your eye. [A50]

Risks of Taking [Name of Study Drug]
Common side effects:
* Headache (2 out of 100 people reported this side effect)
* Nausea (3 out of 100 people reported this side effect)
* Stuffy nose

Less common side effects:
* Rapid heart beat
* Skin rash
* Increase in blood pressure

Uncommon side effects:
* Heart failure

There may be other risks of name of study drug that are currently unknown.[A51]

Risks to Women Who Are or May Become Pregnant
The effect of [name of study drug] on an embryo or fetus (developing baby still in the womb), or on a breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be harmful.  Because of these unknown risks, women cannot take part in this study if they are:
* Pregnant
* Trying to become pregnant
* Breastfeeding or sharing breast milk

If you are a menopausal woman and have not had a menstrual period for the past 12 months or more, you will not need to have a pregnancy test.  Also, you will not need to have a pregnancy test if you have had a hysterectomy (surgical removal of your uterus and/or ovaries).  All other female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test before starting the study drug.

If you are sexually active and able to become pregnant, you must agree to use one of the birth control methods listed below.  You must use birth control for [how long].

Acceptable birth control methods for use in this study are: [refer to Protocol for acceptable birth control methods - examples below]
* Hormonal methods, such as birth control pills, patches, injections, vaginal ring, or implants
* Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a foam, cream, or gel that kills sperm)
* Intrauterine device (IUD)
* Abstinence (no sex)

If you miss a period, or think you might be pregnant during the study, you must tell the study doctor immediately.  If you become pregnant, you must stop taking the study drug.  [if relevant:The study doctor will ask for your permission to collect information about the outcome of your pregnancy and the condition of your newborn.][A52]

Taking Study Drug with Other Medications
Do not take [name of contraindicated medications] while you are in the study.  Taking these drugs and [name of study drug] together may cause serious side effects.

For your safety during this study, call your study doctor BEFORE you take any:
* New medications prescribed by your doctor
* Other medications sold over-the-counter without a prescription
* Dietary or herbal supplements[A53]

Stopping Current Medications 
When you stop taking [medications], your [symptoms/medical condition] might get worse.  If this happens, tell the study doctor.[A54]

Allergic Reaction to Study Drug
Any drug can cause an allergic reaction which could be mild or more serious and can even result in death.  Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, itching, skin problems, swelling of the face and throat, or trouble breathing.  If you are having trouble breathing, call 911 immediately.[A55]

Long Term Risks of Radiation[A56]
