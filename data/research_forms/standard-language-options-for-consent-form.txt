Your baby may cry when the needle pricks the skin.  There may be a bruise on your baby's heel the next day, and your baby's heel may be sore for a couple of days.  We will take blood from your baby  ____ times this way during the study.



  
11. Risks of Having An IV Inserted In Your Vein

In this study we will insert a needle, connected to a plastic tube, into a vein in [on] your <insert body location>.  We will use the tube to take blood samples or give you fluids.  You will feel some pain when we first insert the tube into your vein.  You may have some redness, swelling, or bruising where the tube goes under your skin.  In some cases, this type of  tube can cause an infection where it goes under the skin.  In  rare cases, it can cause a blood clot in the vein.  You will have this tube inserted for about <insert time>.




[Central Venous Line Risks]

12. Risks of Having a Plastic Tube (Central Venous Line) in a Large Vein

In this study we will need to insert a  plastic tube into one of your large veins.  We will use this tube to take blood samples or give you fluids.  Before we insert the tube, we will give you some numbing medicine to reduce the pain.  We will then use a needle to insert the tube under your collarbone or into your neck.  Even with the numbing medicine, you will feel some pain when we insert the needle.  

There are some risks from having a tube like this inserted into your vein.  In rare cases, this type of  tube can cause bleeding, a collapsed lung, or air bubbles in the blood that can lead to a severe brain injury.  If a tube like this is left in place for more than 5 days, there is some risk of infection.  You could also have an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine, but this rare.


[Femoral Artery Catheter Risks]

13. Risks of Having a Plastic Tube (Catheter) In Your Femoral Artery

In  this study we will need to put a plastic tube into the femoral artery in your groin. We will use this tube to take blood samples or give you fluids.  Before we do this, we will give you some numbing medicine to reduce the pain.  Even with the numbing medicine, you will still feel some pain when the needle goes in.  

There are some risks to having a tube like this put into your femoral artery.  There is a very small chance that putting in the tube could cause a tear in your artery, or a blood clot.  There is also a very small chance that putting in the  tube could cause permanent nerve damage.  We will try to prevent these things from happening.  It is rare, but you could also have an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine.




14. Risks Of Having Arterial Blood Gas Taken

In this study we will draw blood from one of your main arteries to see how well your lungs move oxygen into your bloodstream and take carbon dioxide out.  To do this, we will insert a needle into one of your arteries.  We may give you a small amount of numbing medicine to reduce the pain before we put the needle in.  But even with the numbing medicine, you will still feel some pain.  You may also get a small bruise where the needle goes under your skin.  

There is a very small chance that  the needle could damage your artery.  That damage would need to be repaired with surgery.  We will need to perform this test <insert number> times.


15. Risks of Having a Skin Biopsy

In this study we will need to take <insert number>  small sample[s] of your skin.  This procedure is called a "biopsy."  Before we take the sample[s], we will give you some medicine to numb the area.  Then we will press a hollow needle into your skin.  When we take the needle out, it will remove a small circle of skin called a "plug."   

There are some risks to taking a sample of skin this way.  There is a small chance that you could get an infection where the needles goes in.  There is also a small chance that you could have an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine.  After your skin heals up, you may have a small scar where we take the sample. 



16. Risks of Muscle Biopsy
In this study we take a small sample of muscle tissue from you.  This procedure is called "muscle biopsy."  Before we take the tissue samples, we will numb the skin.  We will then make a small cut in the skin and insert a hollow needle.

You may feel discomfort when we inject the numbing medicine (the anesthetic) but during the actual muscle removal, the discomfort should be minimal. There is a risk of infection, muscle cramp, bleeding, bruising, and nerve damage. The risk of infection, muscle cramp, bleeding, and bruising can be minimized if you follow the instructions for caring for the incision. A very small and minor scar may remain as a result of the incision. You could also have an allergic reaction to the numbing drug.  You will be screened prior to the procedure for history of allergic reactions to the numbing medicine (e.g., lidocaine).



[Liver Biopsy Risk]

17. Risks of Having A Liver Biopsy

In this study we will take a small sample of tissue from your liver.  This procedure is called a "biopsy."  Before we take the sample, we will numb the skin outside the liver.   We will then make a small cut in the skin and insert a hollow needle.  You may feel pressure when this needle goes into your liver.  When we take the needle out, it will remove a small circle of tissue from your liver, called a "plug."  

After we take the sample of liver tissue, we may ask you to lie still for 1 to 2 hours to make sure there is no bleeding.  In order to prevent bleeding, you should not take aspirin for 1 week before or 1 week after this procedure.  You should not do any heavy lifting or major exercise for about 2 weeks after this procedure.  

There is a small risk of bleeding after having this procedure, which may require an operation to stop.  In rare cases, taking liver tissue this way may injure an organ next to the liver.  You could also have an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine, but this is rare.  In very rare cases, there have been deaths.



18. Risks of Having a Bone Marrow Sample Taken

In this study we will take a sample of bone marrow from your <insert location> bone.  Before we take the sample, we will give you some numbing medicine on the skin outside your <insert location> bone.  After your skin is numb, we will push a special needle into the center of your <insert location>  bone.  Then we will draw the bone marrow up into the syringe.  When we do this, you will have a "pulling" feeling as the marrow leaves the bone and goes into the syringe.  The area around the bone will be sore for a few days.  

There is a very small chance that you will be allergic to the numbing medicine.  There is also a very small chance that you could bleed or develop an infection.



19. Risks of Having an MRI

In this study we will take Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI's) of your <insert body area>.  The MRI machine uses powerful magnetic waves to take pictures inside the body.  The waves themselves are not harmful, but they can cause metal to heat up and electronics to stop working.  

You should NOT have an MRI if you have metal or electronic devices inside your body.   Heart pacemakers and insulin pumps are examples of electronic devices.

The MRI machine is a small round tube.  It might make you uncomfortable if you do not like tight spaces.  

The most common side effect of having an MRI is flashing lights in the eyes.  This is caused by the magnetic waves and is not harmful.  Some people also experience warmth and reddening of the skin.  This usually goes away after a few minutes. 

If you are pregnant, be sure to tell the person giving you the MRI.

Radiation Risk Statements
If your study involves a radiological procedure, such as X-ray, CT scan, angiogram, or radiation treatment for cancer, select the appropriate risk statement from those that follow.  Most of these statements already contain an estimate of how much radiation the subject will get.  

If you are performing a radiological procedure that is not listed, you may adapt one of the statements below and include an estimate of the radiation dose the subject will receive, expressed in terms of days, months, or years of background radiation. 


* 1 millirem = .01 millisieverts = 1 day's worth of natural background radiation


The best way to estimate the dose a procedure will give a subject is to contact a radiologist or a nuclear medicine specialist at the facility that will perform the procedure.  The radiologist or nuclear medicine specialist will be familiar with the specifications of the machine or with the isotope that will be used and can provide a more accurate estimate than someone outside the facility. 

If you cannot obtain an estimate from the facility that will perform the procedure, you may contact the UCH Radiation Safety Officer, Radiology department for assistance, though you may be charged for assistance.


Note 1:  The FDA states in 21 CFR 361 that any subject of a research study must receive only the smallest dose of radioactive material practical without jeopardizing the results of the study.  

Note 2:  The FDA states also that the radiation dose to a subject who is NOT being treated therapeutically (e.g. for cancer) shall not exceed 3 rem (3,000 millirem; 30 mSv) of radiation in a single procedure or 5 rem (5,000 millirem; 50 mSv) in a single year, to the whole body, active blood-forming organs, lens of the eye, or gonads.



X-ray Risk Statement

20. X-ray Risk

As part of this study we will perform <insert number> X-ray scan[s] of your <insert site>.  X-rays are a type of radiation.  

Your natural environment has some radiation in it.  This series of X-rays will give you about the same amount of radiation that you would get from your environment in  <multiply the number of scans by 2 > days.  


DEXA Risk Statement

21. DEXA Risk

As part of this study we will perform <insert number> DEXA scan[s] of your <insert body area>.  DEXA  is a way of looking inside the body by using X-rays.  X-rays are a type of radiation.

Your natural environment has some radiation in it.  This DEXA will give you about the same amount of radiation that you would get from your environment in  <multiply the number of scans by 2 > days.  
		

Computed Tomography (CT) Risk Statement

	Note to Investigators:  CT's and Children

CT scans are sometimes erroneously compared to standard X-rays in terms of radiation exposure.  In reality, the two procedures give vastly different levels of exposure.  While an X-ray scan will typically result in (an exposure) a whole-body radiation dose of about 2 millirem, or 2 day's worth of  background radiation from the environment, a CT can deliver up to several hundred-even a few thousand-times that amount of radiation.

Due to the potential of CT for delivering large doses of radiation to children, the FDA has issued a Public Health Notification entitled  "Reducing Radiation Risk from Computed Tomography for Pediatric and Small Adult Patients."  Below are some excerpts from this notification:


"The individual risk from the radiation associated with a CT scan is quite small compared to the benefits that accurate diagnosis and treatment can provide.  Still, unnecessary radiation exposure during medical procedures should be avoided.  This is particularly important when the patient is a child, since children exposed to radiation are at a relatively greater risk than adults.  The American College of Radiology has noted, 'Because they have more rapidly dividing cells than adults and have longer life expectancy, the odds that children will develop cancers from x-ray radiation may be significantly higher than adults.' It has been estimated by the National Research Council's Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation that children less than 10 years of age are several times more sensitive to radiation than middle-aged adults. Unnecessary radiation may be delivered when CT scanner parameters are not appropriately adjusted for patient size. When a CT scan is performed on a child or small adult with the same technique factors that are used for a typically-sized adult, the small patient receives a significantly larger effective dose than the full-sized patient." 
 

The FDA goes on to make several recommendations to reduce dose to small patients.  Most of these relate to CT machine settings.  However, the last one pertains to anyone who might order a CT for a patient:


"Eliminate inappropriate referrals for CT.  In some cases,  conventional radiography, sonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be just as effective as CT, and with lower radiation exposure.  Most conventional x-ray units deliver less ionizing radiation than CT systems, and sonography and MRI systems deliver no x-ray radiation at all.  It is important to triage these examinations to eliminate inappropriate referrals or to utilize procedures with less or no ionizing radiation."


So especially when the subject is a child, Investigators should consider whether the data they are trying to obtain requires the use of CT or whether some other modality can provide that data.



Computed Tomography (CT) Risk Statement

	
22. Computed Tomography (CT) Risk

As part of this study we will perform a CT scan of your <insert appropriate body region:  head....chest...abdomen...pelvic area...chest and abdomen....abdomen and pelvic area...chest, abdomen, and pelvic area...>.   CT is a way of taking detailed pictures inside your body by using X-rays.  X-rays are a type of radiation.

You get some radiation from your environment.  You get radiation from bricks and concrete, from some foods, and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas that seeps out of the ground.  The amount of radiation that this CT scan will deliver to your body (give you) is about the same as you would get from living in your environment for <select the appropriate number value, and underline and bold the value:  CT of head= [1 year]...chest= [1 year]...abdomen= [3 years]...pelvic area= [1 year]...chest and abdomen= [4 years]...abdomen and pelvic area= [4 years]...chest, abdomen and pelvic area= [5 years]...>.

[ Note to Investigators:  If you are performing multiple scans, such as a pre-contrast scan, a contrast scan, and a post-contrast scan, be sure to multiply the number you select above for the background radiation by the number of scans you are giving.  e.g. 3 scans of the abdomen multiplied times 3 year's background radiation = 9 year's background radiation.  Delete this paragraph from your consent form when finished. ]

This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you get could be higher or lower, depending on the machine, the power setting, and your body weight. Exposure to radiation at high levels increases a risk of developing cancer. There is no evidence of such risks for diagnostic procedures. 

The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also much higher for young children and teenagers.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30. 



Angiography Risk Statement

23. Angiography Risk

As part of this study we will perform an angiography of your <insert vein name> vein.   An angiography is a way of looking at your veins by using X-rays.  X-rays are a type of radiation.
 
You get some radiation from your environment. It comes from the outer space, from soil, rocks,    bricks and concrete, from some foods, and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas that seeps out of the ground.  The amount of radiation that you will receive during angiography scan will give you is about the same as you would get from living in your environment for 2 years.  

 [ Note to Investigators:  This is a very rough estimate of exposure.  Due to the high variability of procedures calling for angiography, the actual exposure to the patient can vary greatly.  If you can obtain a better estimate of exposure from the radiologist who will be assisting with the procedure, you may use that estimate instead of the one provided here.  The estimate provided here is 600 mrem, or 6mSv = 2 year's background radiation. ]

This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you receive could be higher or lower, depending on your body size and how long the procedure takes.
 
This procedure has some risk.  The FDA estimates that if 1,200 people receive this amount of radiation, 1 of those people will later develop cancer. Note, that a risk of developing cancer in a lifetime for an average person in the United States is 1 in 3.  

[ Note to Investigators:  If you provide your own estimate of radiation exposure above, be sure to adjust the risk factor here.  The FDA states that the risk of fatal cancer after receiving 1 rem, or 10 mSv, is 1 in 2000.  You can adjust this rate proportionately to your dose using this equation:  (10 mSv [or 1000 mrem]   your dose estimation) X 2000.   e.g.:  (10 mSv  15 mSv) X 2000 = 1333.  Rounded to nearest 100, it becomes 1300) ]

The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also significantly higher for young children and teenagers who have this procedure.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30.






Radioactive Tracer Risk Statement (e.g. MUGA)

24. Radioactive Tracer Risk

As part of this study we will perform a <optional; insert scan type> scan of your <insert organ/body part> by using radioactive tracer.  We will first inject the tracer.  Then we will look at the area through a scanner.  You will get some radiation from the tracer.
 
Your natural environment has some radiation in it. It comes from the outer space, from soil, rocks, bricks and concrete, from some foods, and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas that seeps out of the ground.  The amount of radiation that this procedure will give you is about the same as you would get from your environment in  <Note:  contact the radiology department where the scan will be performed and obtain an estimate of whole-body dose equivalent in mSv; then divide that number by 3 mSv>  years.  

This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you receive could be higher or lower, depending on how much tracer is injected into your body, and on your body size. There is a small chance that you can develop cancer. 
  
The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also significantly higher for young children and teenagers who have this procedure.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30.



Bone Scan Risk Statement

25. Bone Scan Risk

As part of this study we will perform a bone scan of your <insert bone name>.   A bone scan is a way of seeing if there are any problems with the way your bones are growing.  

To do the bone scan we will need to inject a radioactive tracer into your blood stream.  You will get some radiation from this tracer.
 
You natural environment has some radiation in it. It comes from the outer space, from soil, rocks, bricks and concrete, from some foods, and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas that seeps out of the ground.  The amount of radiation that this procedure will give you is about the same as you would get from your environment in 1 year.  

This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you receive could be higher or lower, depending on how much tracer is injected into your body, and on your body size. There is a small chance that you can develop cancer. 

The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also significantly higher for young children and teenagers who have this procedure.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30.  


Radiation Therapy Risks

26. Radiation Therapy Risk

As part of this study we will give you radiation therapy to your <insert body area>.  Radiation therapy is a way of destroying cancer tissue while preserving as much of the surrounding healthy tissue as possible.

You get some radiation from your environment.  This procedure will give you radiation in much larger amounts than you would normally get from your environment.  However, the radiation will be concentrated in areas where you have cancer.  

By getting this therapy, you have some risk of developing a second type of cancer.  The actual risk to you depends on many things, such as the amount of radiation you receive and how susceptible your cells are to radiation.  These things are difficult to determine, but the risk of developing a second type of cancer is generally low, 5-7 per 1000.

The actual amount of radiation you get from this procedure will depend on how large the cancer is and how many treatments you receive.  Your doctor can tell you more about this.
  
The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also significantly higher for young children and teenagers who have this procedure.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30.

But, if you request disclosure, we can release the information.
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[The researchers should include language such as the following if they intend to make voluntary disclosure about things such as child abuse, intent to hurt self or others, or other voluntary disclosures.]  The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, without your consent, information that would identify your as a participant in the research project under the following circumstances.
