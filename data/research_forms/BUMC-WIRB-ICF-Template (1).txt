You do not have to participate in any research study offered by your doctor.


PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the drug, DRUG NAME, when used to treat DISEASE NAME.  You are being asked to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with DISEASE NAME, and may meet the study entry requirements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
DRUGNAME is an investigational drug, which means it has not been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In this study, DRUGNAME will be compared to ___________, an approved drug, [and to placebo (a look-alike inactive substance)].  or other, depending on study design

Your participation in this study will last up to LENGTH OF TIME.  Approximately HOW MANY subjects will participate in this study.

PROCEDURES

If random: 
You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either ______________.  may also list as bullets if several arms.

You have _____ chance in ______ of being assigned to placebo, and ______ chance in _____ of receiving ______.  OR You have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups.

If double blind:
Neither you nor the study doctor will know which study drug (OR PROCEDURE OR TREATMENT, ETC) you are receiving.  This information is available to the study doctor if needed in an emergency.  This is done (blinding) so that a fair evaluation of results can be made.

If single blind:
You will not know which study drug you are receiving.  This is done (blinding) so that a fair evaluation of results can be made.

If the study involves a research MRI: 
Pregnancy testing must be done within 48 hours of the MRI and this must be explained in the consent and assent (for minors).  Include this in procedures or under screening procedures.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS

Following is an example: 
Possible side effects associated with the use of DRUG NAME include headache, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and indigestion.  Allergic reaction to DRUG NAME is possible.  Serious allergic reactions that can be life-threatening may occur.

[Or side effect information supplied by sponsor]

There may be side effects which are unknown at this time.

Women who are pregnant or nursing a child may not participate in this study.  You must confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, you are not now pregnant, and that you do not intend to become pregnant during the study. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed (when) to confirm that you are not pregnant. Before entering the study, you and the study doctor must agree on the method of birth control you will use during the entire study.  If you suspect that you have become pregnant during the study, you must notify the study doctor immediately.  Pregnant women will be withdrawn from the study because the risks to the unborn fetus from the study drug are not known.

[or other pregnancy language supplied by sponsor]

If a treatment study:
Your DISEASE NAME may not get better or may become worse while you are in this study.

If the study involves randomization to a placebo:  
Discuss the risk of randomization and the fact that if they receive a placebo, they will not be receiving treatment for their condition.

If study drug is taken home:
Only you can take the study drug.  It must be kept out of the reach of children and persons who may not be able to read or understand the label.

You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.

BENEFITS
Your DISEASE NAME may improve as a result of your participation in this study. If you are on a treatment protocol, you may benefit from the study treatment; however you may not receive any benefit or your condition could worsen. If you are receiving a placebo, you will not benefit directly.  However, there is no guarantee of this.

****information given to the sponsor should be de-identified (coded data given to sponsor with the BUMC PI holding the master code) unless specific justification is given and approved by WIRB to allow the BUMC PI to release /share identifiable information with study sponsor.  (This does not mean that the sponsor's rep/CRO cannot come to BUMC to audit records.) The same policy applies to releasing samples to labs and repositories.  This portion of the consent should reflect this.

For this study, "sponsor" also includes:  [if no CRO or SMO, delete this line also.]

COMPENSATION FOR INJURY
*** Note:  Effective July 1, 2013
BUMC has template language which has been accepted by BUMC IRB and WIRB for the Compensation For Injury Language in the informed consents.   This language contains some "optional statements" which can be inserted, if that is preferred by the sponsor. This template language is the language that should be used on all BUMC WIRB submissions. Changes to this language could result in a delay in processing or in a determination that the study cannot be sent to WIRB for IRB review. Questions about alternate compensation for injury language should be directed to Attorney Anne Clark in the BU Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) at (617) 638-5263.

Add "BUMC Preferred Language for Industry Sponsored Studies" (Revised 7/1/13):
If you think you have been injured by being in this study, contact [insert PI name and contact information] right away.  You can get treatment for the injury at Boston Medical Center.   The study sponsor, [insert sponsor's name], has agreed to cover the reasonable costs of treatment for a research injury that are not covered by your insurance or a government program.   [Optional language:  However, a number of factors will influence whether the sponsor will or will not pay for the injury, such as:  if the injury is a result of normal progression of your disease rather than the research; if you do something that contributes to the injury; if you do not follow the instructions of the investigator or the protocol; or if the investigators do not follow the research protocol.]    A research injury is any injury or illness directly caused by your participation in the study.  If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that you would have received even if you were not in the study, that is not a research injury.  Payment for such things as lost wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering is not routinely available.  To help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions.  You are not giving up any of your legal rights by signing this form.  [Additional optional text:  If you have additional questions about the sponsor's agreement regarding research injuries, please contact Attorney Anne Clark in the BU Office of Sponsored Programs at (617) 638-5263), and she will be happy to assist you or put you in contact with a sponsor's representative to answer your questions.]

OR, add "BUMC Preferred Language for Industry Sponsored Studies Involving Children" (Revised 7/1/13):
If you think your child has been injured by being in this study, contact [insert PI name and contact information] right away. Your child can get treatment for the injury at Boston Medical Center. The study sponsor, [insert sponsor's name], has agreed to cover the reasonable costs of treatment for a research injury that are not covered by your insurance or a government program.   [Optional language:  However, a number of factors will influence whether the sponsor will or will not pay for the injury, such as:  if the injury is a result of normal progression of your child's disease rather than the research; if you or your child do something that contributes to the injury; if you or your child do not follow the instructions of the investigator or the protocol; or if the investigators do not follow the research protocol.]   A research injury is any physical injury or illness directly caused by your child's participation in the study. If your child is injured by a medical treatment or procedure that your child would have received even if he/she were not in the study, that is not a research injury. Payment for such things as lost wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering is not routinely available. To help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions. You and your child are not giving up any of your legal rights by signing this form. [Additional optional text:  If you have additional questions about the sponsor's agreement regarding research injuries, please contact Attorney Anne Clark in the BU Office of Sponsored Programs at (617-638-5263), and she will be happy to assist you or put you in contact with a sponsor's representative to answer your questions.]
