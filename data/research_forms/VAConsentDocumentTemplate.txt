
Note to the Investigator: Informed consent is a process, not just a form. Information must be presented to enable persons to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research participant. It is a fundamental mechanism to ensure respect for persons through provision of thoughtful consent for a voluntary act. The procedures used in obtaining informed consent should be designed to educate the participant population in terms that they can understand. Therefore, informed consent language and its documentation (especially explanation of the study's purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits) must be written in "lay language", (i.e. understandable to the people being asked to participate). The written presentation of information is used to document the basis for consent and for the participants' future reference. The consent document should be revised when deficiencies are noted or when additional information will improve the consent process.

DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH BY INVESTIGATOR

TO POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS
Include the following statement verbatim: Federal regulations require written informed consent before participation in a research study. This is to be certain that research participants know the nature and risks of the study, as they make a decision to take part or not. You are asked to read the following information and discuss it with the investigator, so that you will be fully informed about this research study and how it may affect you. Your signature on this form means that you have been fully informed and that you freely give your consent to participate.

BACKGROUND
Explain that the study involves research and explain the purpose of the research. Briefly tell the participant why this research is being done, why the individual is being invited to participate and how this study will address the problem. Briefly explain who is conducting the study and who is sponsoring the study. If applicable, describe why current therapies are not satisfactory and why an alternative treatment or approach will be used. If applicable, state that the drug or device used in the study is or is not investigational and whether or not it has been approved by the FDA. Other suggested elements appear in the first example.

Example: You are being asked to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with friends and relatives if you wish. Ask the research doctor or staff if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not to volunteer to take part in this research study.  
Example: The purpose of the study is <<explain purpose of the research using simple, accurate language>>. This study is being conducted by <<insert sponsor, granting agency, investigator, etc.>>.

For studies involving Phase I, II, or III the following sample explanations may be included.
Example: Phase 1 studies are early human studies done after the animal models have given basic data. They are done on a small number of people to find out about safe dose ranges. 
Example: Phase 2 studies are done on a larger number of human subjects to see if a new drug is safe. They are also done to find out if the drug works and does what it is supposed to do. 
Example: Phase 3 studies test a new drug longer and on more people. They are done to learn details about the use of the new drug in many people during their usual activities of daily living. 

STUDY PROCEDURES
This section should tell the participant about what they will have to do, undergo or experience in the study. Describe all procedures in lay language using simple terms and short sentences. Include a description of the study procedures involved and identify which treatments or procedures that are experimental. (Standard therapy should be included if it is part of the study protocol.) Provide a time-line description (e.g. week 1, week 2, 4 weeks later, etc.) of the procedures that will be performed, the drugs that will be administered, all hospitalizations, and all outpatient visits, etc. Include the total length of time that the participants will be involved both in the active study and for follow-up.

If applicable, include information regarding pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential and indicate the frequency of pregnancy testing. 

The following are suggested lay definitions which may be included if applicable:
Randomized Trial: A research trial usually involves comparing different treatments. In a trial, one group will get one treatment and another group will get a different treatment. In a "randomized trial" people are put in one group or the other by random chance. This means that a computer will decide by chance which group a person is in, not the doctors running the trial.

Patients should be told what chance they have of getting the study drug/treatment e.g. a one in four chance, a 50:50 chance, etc.

Single Blind Trial: In a blind trial you will not know which treatment group you are in. 

Double Blind Trial: In this trial, neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment group you are in (although, if your doctor needs to find out for important medical reasons, he/she can do so).

For studies involving placebo or withheld treatment, the following must be addressed:  
* The reason for the placebo or withheld treatment must be explained.
* "Placebo" should be defined in lay terms. 
* Any withheld treatment must be detailed. 
* Any related procedures should be detailed in this section. If applicable, include any plan for rescue therapy, special monitoring, or crossover to placebo.

Example definition of placebo: A placebo is a dummy treatment such as a pill which looks like the pill that contains the study drug but is not. Placebos contain no drugs or active ingredients. Study participants are given placebos so that the effects of a drug can be compared against no drug.  Use of placebos also prevents the subject and the doctor from knowing whether or not the participant is getting the drug.
  
RISKS
Include a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts or side-effects the participant may experience for each procedure and drug (including the possibility that an experimental treatment may be ineffective). List all side effects which are life-altering or potentially life-altering, no matter how rare. Minor risks such as the possible breach of confidentiality should be listed.

For studies involving placebo or withheld treatment, potential risks must be adequately explained, including any risks of non-treatment. 

REPRODUCTIVE RISKS
For studies involving possible reproductive risks, please include a section that includes the following:
1. State any known risks in pregnancy, either to mother or child.
2. State that there may be unforeseeable risks to the participant (or to the embryo or fetus) if the participant is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the study.
3. List the acceptable methods of birth control for this research project.
4. Describe what action will occur in the event of pregnancy (i.e. follow-up of pregnancy outcome, immediate withdrawal from the study, etc.)

Example: It is possible that if the treatment is given to a pregnant woman it will harm the unborn child. Pregnant women must not take part in this study, nor should women who plan to become pregnant during the study. Women who are at risk of pregnancy will be asked to have a pregnancy test before taking part to exclude the possibility of pregnancy. If you could become pregnant must use an effective contraceptive during the course of this study. Acceptable methods of birth control include <<list acceptable methods>>.  If you become pregnant while taking part in the study, you must immediately tell your research doctor. Options will be discussed with you at that time. Whether or not you remain on study treatment, we will follow the outcome of your pregnancy and we will continue to follow you according to the study plan.

BENEFITS
This section should describe any potential benefits to the participant or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research. DO NOT include any compensation to be offered to participants. The description of benefits to the participant should be clear and not overstated to avoid coercion. If no direct benefit is anticipated, it should be stated. If research results will be given to the participant, it should be stated.

Example: We cannot promise any benefits to you from your being in the study. However, possible benefits may include <<list benefits>>. 
Example: There are no direct benefits to you from your taking part in this study. The information we get from this study may help us treat future patients.
Example: We hope that this study will help you, however, this cannot be guaranteed.  

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES
Describe any alternative procedures or courses of treatment that might be advantageous to the participant. To enable a rational choice about participating in the research study, individuals should be aware of the full range of options available to them including palliative or comfort care (if applicable). If standard therapy is part of the study protocol, the participant must be told he/she can receive it outside of the study.

Example: You may choose not to participate in this study. If you do not want to take part in the study, there are other choices such as <<list alternatives>>.You may discuss these options with your doctor. 

CONFIDENTIALITY
Describe the procedures used to maintain the confidentiality of the records and data pertaining to the participant, how the participant's privacy will be protected and who may inspect the records. If you are collecting social security numbers, inform participants of this fact. Tell participants whether they can withhold their social security number and still participate.  If the research is subject to FDA regulation, a statement must be included that notes the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records.  If this study is conducted at the University of Utah and the VA, a statement must be included that this is a multi-site study that combines VA data with non-VA data, and the location (i.e. University of Utah or VA) where data will be combined and analyzed for the study.

Example: Results of this study may be published, but your identity will not appear in any such publication.  
Example: We will keep all research records that identify you private to the extent allowed by law. Records about you will be kept <<indicate how records are kept, e.g. locked in filing cabinets, on computers protected with passwords or encryption, etc.>>. Only those who work with this study or are performing their job duties for <<the University, the VA, Primary Children's Medical Center, etc.>> will be allowed access to your information. 
Example: Representatives from <<insert name of group(s) e.g. FDA, NIH, DHHS, sponsor, etc.>> may inspect and/or copy the records that identify you. Results of the study may be published; however, your name and other identifying information will be kept private. We will do everything we can to keep your records private, but cannot guarantee this.
Example: This study is being conducted at the VA and the University of Utah.  Information about you will be shared with University researchers for this study.  The data will be stored at the <<insert location, e.g. University of Utah, VA>>.

If this research represents a clinical trial that must be registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, you must include the following statement verbatim:
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time.

If applicable, please provide a description of the Certificate of Confidentiality and any voluntary disclosure plans by the Investigator(s). For more information regarding Certificates of Confidentiality, please refer to the IRB website.

If HIV testing is performed as a result of study participation, state that additional consent will be required for the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics or PCMC (as applicable) which describes how results will be given to the participant and the methods or opportunities participants will be given for appropriate counseling and medical care.  

If testing is performed as a result of study participation for any communicable or infectious diseases reportable by Utah State law is performed as a result of study participation, the following must be addressed in this section (refer to http://health.utah.gov/epi/report.html for a current list of Utah's reportable diseases):
* Tell the participant about the state reporting.
* Describe how results will be given to the participant to comply with state reporting requirements.  
* Describe the methods or opportunities participants will be given for appropriate counseling and medical care.  

PERSON TO CONTACT

If the study involves serious risks, a number with 24-hour availability must be provided. If the number is a pager or the hospital operator include further instructions for contacting the appropriate individual.  

Include specific information about who the participant should contact in case of a research-related injury. This should include name(s), telephone number(s), and when the person(s) listed may be contacted. If applicable, provide information about who to contact if the participant has questions about the billing of costs in the study.  

Example: If you have questions, complaints or concerns about this study, you can contact <<insert name>> at <<insert phone number>>. If you think you may have been injured from being in this study, please call <<insert name>> at <<insert phone number>>. <<Insert name>> can be reached at this number during <<specify hours or state it is a number available 24-hours a day>>.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD
Include the following statement verbatim:  Contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if you have questions regarding your rights as a research participant. Also, contact the IRB if you have questions, complaints or concerns which you do not feel you can discuss with the investigator. The University of Utah IRB may be reached by phone at (801) 581-3655 or by e-mail at irb@hsc.utah.edu.  

MEDICAL TREATMENT OR COMPENSATION FOR INJURY 
Include the following statement verbatim: The VA has the authority to provide medical treatment to participants injured by participation in a VA study.  If you are injured as a result of being in this study, the VA will provide the necessary medical treatment in accordance with federal law. If you want to make a legal claim against the VA or anyone who works for the VA, special laws may apply. The Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671-2680) is a federal law that controls when and how a person can bring a claim against the U.S. Government. If you sign this document you re not giving up your right to make a legal claim against the United States. 

If the study has a third party sponsor, the participant may have other options for treatment. The options should be explained in a separate section.  Provide a copy of the relevant contract to the VA research office so consistency can be verified.

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
State that participation is voluntary. Indicate that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled. Also indicate that the participant may discontinue participation at any time without any penalty or loss to benefits. If applicable, state that the participant may withdraw and still receive the same standard of care that he or she would otherwise have received.  

Example: It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part in this study. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. Refusal to participate or the decision to withdraw from this study will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you don't take part, you can still receive all standard care that is available to you. This will not affect the relationship you have with your doctor or other staff, nor decrease the standard of care that you receive as a patient.

Explain any possible consequences of a participant's decision to withdraw from the research. Describe any adverse effects on the participant's health or welfare, or any extra follow-up that may be requested, if the participant decides to withdraw from the study. Explain the procedures for an orderly termination of participation. Such an explanation may be omitted if there are no adverse consequences to withdrawal.

Example: If you want to stop being in this study, please let the research doctor know. That way you can find out what should be done about your routine care outside of the study.

UNFORESEEABLE RISKS
State that participation in the study may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable. 

Example: In addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect. 

RIGHT OF INVESTIGATOR TO WITHDRAW
Describe foreseeable circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's consent. This section may be omitted if there are no anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated. If withdrawal of a participant by the investigator can occur, possible reasons should be listed. Describe any procedures required for an orderly termination of participation.  

Example: The investigator can withdraw you without your approval. Possible reasons for withdrawal include <<list reason(s) why the participant may be withdrawn>>. 

Include a description of any adverse effects on the participant's health or welfare, or follow-up that may be requested if the participant is withdrawn from the study.

COSTS TO PARTICIPANTS AND COMPENSATION
Include a statement that veteran-participants will not be required to pay for care received as a participant in a VA research project except as follows: Certain veterans are required to pay co-payments for medical care and services provided by the VA. Veterans receiving medical care and services from the VA that are not rendered as part of the VA-approved research study, must pay any applicable co-payment for such care and services.  

Example: A veteran participant will not be required to pay for care and services (treatment) received as a subject in a VA research project. However, some veterans are required to pay co-payments for medical care and services provided by the VA. These co-payment requirements will continue to apply to medical care and services provided by the VA that are not part of this study.

If participants must bear any additional costs (e.g. transportation, time away from work, health costs, etc.) it must be disclosed in the informed consent information. Any such costs must be consistent with Federal laws concerning veterans' eligibility for medical care and treatment. Indicate if the participant will receive payment of any kind (i.e., money, gift certification, etc.) for participation in this study.

NEW INFORMATION
State that new findings developed during the course of the research that may affect to the participant's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject. This section may be omitted if new information could not reasonably used to alter participation (e.g. one-time interventions). 

Example: Sometimes during the course of a research project, new information becomes available about the <<treatment/drug>> that is being studied. If this happens, your research doctor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the study.  
Example (additional text if applicable): If you decide to withdraw at that time, your research doctor will make arrangements for your medical care to continue. If you decide to continue in the study, you will be asked to sign an updated consent form. Also, on receiving new information your research doctor might consider it to be in your best interests to withdraw you from the study. He/she will explain the reasons and arrange for your medical care to continue.

NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS
State the approximate number of participants to be enrolled. Indicate whether this study is part of a national study.

Example: We expect to enroll <<enter number>> participants at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS). 
Example: We also expect to enroll <<enter number>> participants at <<enter number>> other medical centers.
