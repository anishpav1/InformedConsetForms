You have been asked to participate in this study because you [fill in why the prospective volunteer was asked to participate and how they were selected]. There will be approximately [fill in total expected participants of enrolled at this site] participants at this site and approximately [fill in total expected enrollment at all sites, as appropriate] participants at all sites.Why is this study being done?The purpose of this study is [fill in with a brief description of the research purpose(s)].What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:[List study procedure(s) here, making clear which procedure(s) or treatment(s) are experimental and which are standard of care.[If randomization is used to assign subjects to a study group include] You will be assigned by chance to a study group. Your chance of being assigned to each group is [fill in with the chance of assignment such as 1 in 3]. Neither you nor the researcher(s) can choose the group to which you will be assigned. [For each study group, fill in with an explanation of what will happen in the group indicating clearly the interventions that are different from standard of care].[If a standard of care procedures are associated with the study, the following guidelines should be used to describe those standard procedures:a)	If the standard procedure is not explicitly required by the study protocol, the consent form need not describe the procedure; or b)	If the standard procedure is the main focus of the study (e.g., one or more of the study groups are randomized to standard of care) or is explicitly required by the study, the consent form must include a full description of the procedure.]How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?[Provide the duration/time associated with each study procedure and a separate statement indicating the overall duration of the subject’s involvement in the study].What risks are associated with this study?Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include the following: [insert numbered list of risks reasonably expected here including risk of loss of confidentiality].[If the study involves randomization include] You will be assigned to a study group at random (by chance). Your assignment is based on chance rather than a medical decision made by the researchers. The study group you are assigned to might not be the group you would prefer to be in. Your assigned study group might also prove to be less effective or have more side effects than the other study groups(s), or other treatments available for your condition.[If a standard of care procedures are associated with the study, the following guidelines should be used to describe the risks associated with those standard procedures:a)	If the standard procedure is not explicitly required by the study protocol, the consent form need not describe the risks associated with the procedure; or b)	If the standard procedure is the main focus of the study (e.g., one or more of the study groups are randomized to standard of care) or is explicitly required by the study, the consent form must include a full description of the risks associated with the procedure.][Additionally, if the child is of child-bearing potential and the study procedures may pose some unforeseeable risks to the reproductive system or developing fetus, please include the following three paragraphs.]The effects of the study procedures and study drug may pose some unforeseeable risks on the reproductive system (sperm, eggs) or to the developing fetus. For this reason, while in this study, you should not become pregnant and agree to either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable, effective contraception for this period, such as hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide, contraceptive sponge or use of condom by the partner [revise list of reliable, effective contraception, as appropriate].After you are enrolled in this study and during the research, pregnancy testing will be performed. The results of the pregnancy test are confidential and will be told to you by one of the study nurses or doctors in private. Every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality regarding positive pregnancy test results. Our policy is that we would not tell your parent(s) or guardian(s) without your permission. However, under certain circumstances, we might be compelled to reveal this information. For example, if your life or someone else's life was at risk or if abuse was suspected, it may be necessary to inform your parent(s) or guardian(s) of a positive pregnancy test. If we believe it's necessary to tell your parent or guardian of a positive pregnancy test without your permission, we would meet with you first in private to discuss our concerns prior to divulging any information regarding pregnancy.During the research, if you do have a positive pregnancy test, we may withdraw you from the study. This means that even if we do not reveal the results, your parent(s) or guardian(s), may suspect that you are pregnant despite our best efforts to maintain confidentiality. If you become pregnant or if there is any chance that you might be pregnant (late menstrual period, broken condom, missed oral contraceptive pills, etc) please contact the study personnel immediately so that we may provide medical assistance and counseling. The phone call will be strictly confidential, and we will not notify your parent(s) or guardian(s) without your permission.[If this study involves exposure to radiation, please include the following two paragraphs:]During your participation in this research study, you will be exposed to radiation from scheduled x-rays and/or imaging scans. The total exposure resulting from these imaging studies is calculated to be approximately [fill in with appropriate amount of exposure] mSv. This amount is [more/less/equal—choose one] than you would receive from one year of natural exposure in the San Diego area, which is approximately 1.6 mSv. Cumulative exposure from radiation may increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer in the future.The principal investigator for this research study has determined and verified that [all/most/some—choose one] of the x-rays and/or imaging scans prescribed for this study would typically be performed as part of the standard medical care required to adequately monitor your current illness. [Investigator may be specific here by listing the scans that are considered standard of care if applicable or deemed to be useful information for the research subject. In addition, non-radiation producing imaging alternatives would be included here if described in the Research Plan.] If you are especially concerned with radiation exposure, or you have had a lot of x-rays or imaging scans already, you should discuss this with the principal investigator for this study, Dr. [fill in with name of principal investigator], or your regular doctor.Because this is a research study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.What are the alternatives to participating in this study?The alternatives to participation in this study are [fill in appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment or supportive care, if any, that may be advantageous to the subject].What benefits can be reasonably expected?There may or may not be any direct benefit to you from these procedures.
