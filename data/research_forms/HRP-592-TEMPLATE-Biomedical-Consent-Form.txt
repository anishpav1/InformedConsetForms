What is research?		
Doctors and researchers are committed to your care and safety. There are important differences between research and treatment plans:
						
● The goal of research is to learn new things in order to help groups of people in the future. Researchers learn things by following the same plan with a number of participants, so they do not usually make changes to the plan for individual research participants. You, as an individual, may or may not be helped by volunteering for a research study.
● The goal of treatment is to help you get better or to improve your quality of life. Doctors can make changes to your treatment plan as needed.

You will be asked whether the investigator can collect information from your routine medical care, such as your medical records. [Note: The consent document cannot give the participant the option of having data removed.] If you agree, this information will be handled the same as the information obtained for the research study. [Note: If a participant withdraws from the interventional portion of a study and does not consent to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access the participant's medical record or other confidential records requiring the participant's consent for purposes related to the study. However, an investigator may review study data related to the participant collected prior to the participant's withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as those establishing survival status.]

[For research that is not FDA-regulated, describe what will happen to data collected to the point of withdrawal. Describe whether participants will be asked to explain the extent of their withdrawal and whether they will be asked for permission to collect data through interaction or collection of private identifiable information.

[Describe any compensation available for research-related injury dictated by the Clinical Trial Agreement or contract.]

[Include for research involving genetic information. Otherwise delete.] A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.
