This section is to be added to the consent form if tissue was being sent to a central lab and the issue was not specifically addressed by the sponsor.
Use of Specimens for Research 

Some research studies make use of body tissues or specimens that are obtained during the normal course of a hospital or doctor visit.  Tissues and specimens that are most often used in other research studies include blood, the cells extracted during a biopsy, urine, and other body fluids.  Usually, these samples or specimens are analyzed in a lab to help treat or monitor a patient’s condition and then discarded. 

In this particular study, the study team is requesting your consent to hold samples of your tissues or specimens for an indefinite period of time, even after you are no longer participating in the study. The tissues/specimens will be held in a central laboratory and will only be identified by a code. Your name will not be written or recorded directly on the sample container; the lab will keep a record (or key) of the sample’s code number and your name in a separate file that is kept secure and available only to persons in the lab who maintain those files.  Your name and address will remain confidential at all times.

If you consent to the use of your tissues or specimens in future research, your tissue will be used for research purposes only. It will not be sold. Small samples of your tissue may be provided to other researchers, at their request, and only if their research studies have the approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB approval of such studies is important because it means that the researcher has taken steps to protect the rights of the participants in a study, including tissue donors.  

Studies that might make use of your stored tissue or specimens may cover any number of medical topics, including genetic research (research about diseases that are passed on from parent to child).  Because your tissues will be identified by code number only, it will not be possible for the researcher or hospital to contact you when your samples are used, and you will not be contacted about the results of the other research done with your tissue.  No results will be recorded in your medical records.

It is possible that researchers who use your tissues or specimens may need more detailed information about your health. If that is the case, the researcher will contact your doctor or the hospital for that information, and will only be given information about your health, not your name or other identifying information.

Your decision whether or not to allow the use of your tissues in future research will not change your current care and treatment. You will receive the care you need even if you decide not to contribute your tissue samples or specimens.  You may withdraw your approval at any time by contacting your doctor and withdrawing your consent for future use of your tissues or specimens.

The information obtained from the study of your stored tissues or specimens may benefit other people, including people with your condition or disease, in the future.   Contributing your tissue samples or specimens may have no direct benefit to you at this time.    
You may choose the kinds of research that you will allow your tissues to be used for.  Please review the options below.
