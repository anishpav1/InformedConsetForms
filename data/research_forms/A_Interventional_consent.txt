You are invited to take part in this research study. This form tells you why this research study is being done, what will happen in the research study, possible risks and benefits to you, your choices, and other important information. If there is anything that you do not understand, please ask questions. Then you can decide if you want to join this study or not.  

A1. INTRODUCTION – WHY ARE WE ASKING YOU ABOUT THIS STUDY?
Describe reason(s) for subject participation, such as diagnosis and eligibility, and a brief description of the key intervention.
You are being invited to participate in this research study because …[you have had X condition for more than 6 months.  Because of your condition, you may be eligible for a research study on a new drug for … / a device to be implanted in your chest which senses changes in blood pressure…]

A total of about xx people are expected to participate in this study [nationally / world-wide  / all at / including about xx at] the Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital/BloodCenter of Wisconsin.

The Director of the study is <Principal Investigator> in the <Department of XYZ>. A study team works with <Principal Investigator>. You can ask who these people are. 

<Sponsor>, a drug company, is funding the study. OR The National Institute of Health, a government agency, OR the American Heart Association is funding this study.

If a financial conflict of interest needs to be explained, state it here.

A2. DO I HAVE TO BE IN THIS STUDY?
You can decide whether to take part in this study or not. You are free to say yes or no. If you say no, your regular medical care will not change. Even if you join this study, you do not have to stay in it. You may stop at any time. 

A research study is different from routine medical care in three ways: 1) there are extra risks that we will tell you about in this form; 2) you may have some extra medical tests and visits; 3) the study procedures, tests and visits follow a set plan that must be kept.

A3. WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?
Describe the purpose of the study.
  - For drug studies, select the Phase example for your study. For a study of mixed phases, choose the lowest phase to describe your study.
 - For device or other studies, see the instruction section below.

For Phase 1 drug studies:
In this study we want to find out more about the side effects (problems and symptoms) of a new drug for [X condition], [drug name] and what doses of [drug name] are safe for people to take. Everyone in this study will receive [drug name] which is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  We do not know all the ways that this drug may affect people. This study is not likely to help you, but we hope the information from this study will help us develop a better treatment for [X condition] in the future. 

For Phase 2 drug studies:
In this study we want to find out more about a new drug, [drug name], in people with [X condition]. We want to find out whether the new drug [drug name] reduces the symptoms of [X condition], and whether it causes any problems (side effects). Everyone in this study will receive [drug name], which is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration / is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients but not with your condition.  We are testing [drug name] to see what effect it has on people with [X condition]. We don’t know if this study will help you. Your condition may get better but it could stay the same or even get worse. We hope the information from this study will help us develop a better treatment for [X condition] in the future.

For Phase 3 drug studies, or studies with comparator:
In this study we want to find out whether a new drug for [X condition], [drug name], is better than Old-drug, a routine treatment for [X condition]. To do this, we will compare the two drugs in people with [X condition] and see which one reduces pain faster or better, and which one is safer (causes fewer problems). [Drug name] is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration / is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients but not with [X condition].  [Drug name] may have advantages over Old-drug, but we won’t know until we do more research studies.
We don’t know if this study will help you. Your condition may get better but it could stay the same or even get worse. We hope the information from this study will help us develop a better treatment for [X condition] in the future.

For Phase 4 drug studies, describe the post marketing study: 
This drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and in this study we want to learn more about …

For device studies, describe the FDA status of the device in a way the subject is likely to understand, so that the subject knows the FDA’s ruling on the safety and effectiveness of the device and the FDA indication(s) for the device. Please see the sample modules:
 - Approved or cleared (510(k)) devices used ON indication / OFF indication
 - Devices studied under Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) used ON Indication / OFF indication
 - Non-significant Risk devices
 - HUDs with HDE status, used OFF indication

Describe the purpose of the device or other (surgery, etc.) study…

B1. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  

Provide a concise overall summary of the procedures. 
• Begin with screening procedures, if applicable.
• Describe the study groups and explain randomization, placebo, blinding if applicable.
• Use lay language and explain the purpose of the procedure if it is unfamiliar. 
• Include the duration of each visit or procedure. 
• Emphasize drugs/procedures specifically for the research, compared to routine care. 
• State if any procedure is experimental.
• An attachment may be added [Attachment #1, optional] with details of the study schedule and procedures. 

Screening procedures: 
If the study requires screening procedures, briefly describe; otherwise delete.  
If you decide to join the study, some screening tests will be done first to see if you are eligible. [Describe screening procedures].

If the screening information shows that you meet the requirements, then you will be able to start the study. If the screening information shows that you cannot be in the research study, the study doctors will discuss other options with you and/or refer you back to your regular doctor. 

Research study groups
If the study has interventional groups, describe the groups and how they are defined.
[Describe the groups, for example… to find out if a new drug for headaches, new-drug, is better than Old-drug, the routine treatment for headaches, one group of people in the study will be given new-drug and a second group of people will be given Old-drug.  We will check how many headaches people have after one month, and compare the results in the two groups.]  

If the study has a placebo, insert the following in description of groups above: 
You should know that the placebo is a pill [or infusion, etc.] that contains no real medicine and we do not expect it will do anything for your health. 

If the study is randomized, insert the following:
Because no one knows which of the [drugs/devices/interventions] is best, you will be “randomized” into one of the [two / three / etc.] study groups. [One group will receive new-drug and one group will receive Old-drug]. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin.  You will have a(n) [equal / one in three /explain weighting, etc.] chance of being placed in [either / any] group. Neither you nor the study doctor can choose what group you will be in. 

If the study is double-blinded, insert the following, or modify for single-blind:
Since the expectations of patients and doctors can influence the results of a study, neither you nor your study doctor can know which drug you will get until the study is over. A computer program chooses which group you are in, and the pills (infusion, etc) in each group will look the same. In an emergency, your doctor can find out which drug you are taking.

Summary of Study Procedures:
Provide a summary of study procedures

Include the following if research involves donating a unit of blood in any BloodCenter donor room, apheresis procedure or infectious disease testing.
As part of the procedure for donating a unit of blood, your blood will be tested for diseases that can be passed on to other people by transfusion, including AIDS (the disease caused by the HIV virus), syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and others. If certain tests are positive, BloodCenter of Wisconsin may inform you, put your name on a list of ineligible donors, and inform certain government health agencies as required by law. Results of your blood test for HIV will be released only to authorized persons as governed by Wisconsin law. A list of persons to be notified and reasons that will cause release of your blood test for HIV is available upon request. Results of the test for HIV will be released to BloodCenter physicians and their assistants. Abnormal test results of active military personnel will be forwarded to the military medical authority of the base to which you are assigned, as required by the Department of Defense.

B2. HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?
Choose one or more options and modify regarding the subject’s involvement:
==> You will be in this research study for about [estimated length of time of subject’s involvement].  
==> You will take the [study drug] for ____ months/ weeks.

B3. CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
Choose one or more of these options and modify:
You are free to withdraw from the study at any time. If you leave, your regular medical care will not change. If you are thinking about leaving, please tell the study doctor. 
==> The doctor can tell you about the effects of stopping, and you and the doctor can talk about what follow-up care would help you the most.
==> You might be asked to come back for one more visit to check your health.
