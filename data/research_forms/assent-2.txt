UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO
ASSENT TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY

Study Title: ACTG 273, Version 1.0: A Phase I/II Study of HIVIG in Slowing Progression of Disease in HIV-Infected Children

What is this study about?

Diane Whittle, M.D., and Alejandro Solis, M.D., from the Department of Pediatrics, are doing a research study.  A research study is when doctors collect a lot of information to learn more about something.  This study is to find out if a medicine called HIVIG is safe for treating children with HIV.

Because you are infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the doctors are asking you if you want to be in this study.

What will happen to you if you are in this study?

1. First, the study doctor will ask you questions about your health.  You will have a physical exam, and you will give some urine and some blood for testing.

2. Then, if you are going to stay in the study, you will get HIVIG.  The HIVIG medicine will be given through a needle in your arm.

3. During the 9 months of the study, you will need to visit the clinic at least 19 times for physical exams and blood tests.  Each visit will last 1 to 7 hours.  [If some or all of exams/blood draws would be done anyway as part of child's clinical care, emphasize what will be done extra for the study.]

4. You will be given HIVIG 6 times, about once a month.

Will any parts of the study hurt?

It may hurt when a needle is put in your arm to take blood or to give you the HIVIG.  The doctors will ask you if you want a numbing medicine on your skin to try and make it hurt less.

Will you get better if you are in this study?

You may get a little better by being this study or you may stay healthier for a longer time, but we don't know if that will happen.  The doctors don't think that the HIVIG will make your HIV infection go away completely.

What if you have questions?

You can ask Dr. Whittle, Dr. Solis, or the nurses who work them any questions you have about the study.  You can ask your questions now or later, any time you like. You can also ask your parents to ask questions for you.

What are your choices?

If your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to, but you don't have to be in it if you don't want to.  No one will get mad at you if you don't want to do this. If you decide to be in this study now and you change your mind later, that's okay, too.  You just have to tell the doctors.

If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.

If you want to be in this study, just tell us.
The doctor will give you a copy of this form to keep.
