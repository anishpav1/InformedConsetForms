This consent form may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the study doctor or the study staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.  You may print an unsigned copy of this consent form to think about or discuss with family or friends before making your decision.

SUMMARY

You are being asked to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to help you decide if you want to be in the research study.  Please read this form carefully.  To be in a research study you must give your informed consent.  “Informed consent” includes:
• Completing the online tutorial
• Reading this consent form,
• Asking questions to the investigator or staff about anything that is not clear, and
• Printing out an unsigned copy of this consent form.  This gives you time to think about it and to talk to family or friends before you make your decision.

You should not join this research study until all of your questions are answered.

Things to know before deciding to take part in a research study:  
• The main goal of a research study is to learn things to help patients in the future.
• The main goal of regular medical care is to help each patient.
• The decision to join or not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits.  If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat you.
• After going through the online materials and reading the consent form you should understand the goals of the research study and the risks of taking part in the study.
• Any data you contribute such as personal genomic or health data or your medical records may become part of the research record.  If that happens, your data and medical records will be looked at and/or copied by the sponsor of this study and government agencies or other groups associated with the study.


PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

• Traditionally, most scientific research involves selected individuals who volunteer time, contribute samples and data in the name of improving our collective understanding and small groups of researchers who analyze that data and publish their findings in scientific literature. Once the project is over, it’s over, and re-using the data is hard to do.
• The purpose of this study is to create a far larger group of participants, to make it far easier to re-use the data again and again, and to allow any volunteer to play an active role in the scientific research process. The study is possible through technical and legal tools that permit participants to broadly share and distribute their data for research purposes, and tools that make it easy for researchers to use your data to improve our common understanding of human genomics and health. 
• The experimental components of this study are:
o The completion of mixed- media information modules and an online informed consent process.
o The provision of personal, genomic and health-related information 
o The broad availability of the collected datasets to any interested researcher who have explicitly agreed to the study’s terms and conditions..
• One of the primary aims of the CGR is to build large, open datasets and tools that make it easy for scientists to work together and innovate by utilizing health data. While we believe that promoting public research is crucial to the rapid advancement of scientific and medical knowledge, we also recognize that it carries a unique set of risks and considerations for participants. This document is designed to help you understand those risks and to make an informed choice about whether to participate in Creating a Self-contributed Genomic data cohort/ PLC-CGR

PROCEDURES

• Sage Bionetworks is conducting a study that will collect genomic, phenotypic, observational, health-related and other forms of information from volunteer individuals. 
• The information will be owned by the individuals (i.e., already in their possession) and uploaded by electronic means, including websites and software applications. 
• The information will be provided by the individuals to the study, and not generated by the study investigators. 
• To respect participant’s privacy, unless otherwise requested, information that can directly identify the participant will be removed from the data prior to making it available to researchers.  Information that can directly identify participants are:
1.Names;2.All geographical subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.3.All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older;4.Phone numbers;5.Fax numbers;6.Electronic mail addresses;7.Social Security numbers;8.Medical record numbers;9.Health plan beneficiary numbers;10.Account numbers;11.Certificate/license numbers;12.Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;13.Device identifiers and serial numbers;14.Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);15.Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;16.Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints;17.Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and18.Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data)
o However, even with removal of these identifying information points, it is sometimes possible to re-identify individuals uniquely given enough information about the individual. This risk should be contemplated prior to enrolling.
• Individuals will be assigned a “global unique identifier” (GUID) that will be published alongside their data. The GUID will allow for new data that participants upload to be connected to their old data, or for data that is uploaded from multiple venues to be connected. The GUID will also serve as a mechanism for researchers to send messages to participants without having to reveal the identities of participants.
• Data collected will be made available, for research purposes, to a broad variety of users who have agreed to be bound by a contract and to specific terms and conditions that include use of the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm, not re-identify or re-contact individuals, and to make their research results openly available to the general public.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
The main risk of donating your personal, genetic and health-related information is the loss of confidentiality.
The following is a non-comprehensive list of scenarios that could pose risks for you and/or your family:
• Data that you provide (such as trait data or DNA sequence or other genetic data) may be used to identify you.  This may, among other things, result in contact from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or negative feelings about one or more studies. This could mean a significant loss of privacy and personal time.
• If you enroll in the creation of a Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort, it is possible that data not intended to be published (e.g., your name, date of birth, or contact information) will be publicly disclosed due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study, or may be used for unauthorized purposes despite the restrictions that those using data are required to agree to. Should this occur you would be subject to the various risks and discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form, and possibly to other risks as well, even though you did not intend for such data to be published or misused.
• The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could cause you to learn – either directly, from a family member or from another individual – certain unexpected genealogical features about you and/or your family. In particular, you might learn things about your genetic features that might cast doubt on paternity in your family.
• The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to reveal to you or a member of your family the possibility of a disease or other trait or propensity for a disease or other trait.
• The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to claim statistical evidence, including with respect to your genetic predisposition to certain diseases or other traits, that could affect the ability of you and/or your family to obtain or maintain employment, insurance or financial services (for example, “your genotype indicates you have a statistically higher probability of prostate cancer, and thus life insurance premiums increase);
• Whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or attempted employment, insurance, financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic and trait information through this study or by a third party. Although United States law bars certain forms of genetic discrimination (the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, also known as GINA), this law does not apply to the use of genetic information in all circumstances and, even where it does apply, it does not guarantee that your genetic information will not be used against you in a way that you feel is discriminatory or otherwise harmful to you and/or your family.
• If you have previously made available or intend to make available genetic or other medical or trait information in a confidential setting, for example in another research study, the data that you provide to the Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort may be used, on its own or in combination with your previously shared data, to identify you as a participant in otherwise private and/or confidential research. This means that any data or other information you may have shared pursuant to a promise of confidentiality or privacy may become public despite your intent that they be kept private and confidential. This could result in certain adverse effects for you, including ones not considered or anticipated by this consent form.
• Your commonly available DNA sequence data, trait data and other information will include certain information that applies to your family members. Some people may draw conclusions from your commonly available information, including speculating about what such information might reveal about you and your family members. As a result, we cannot predict all of the risks, or the severity of the risks, that the public availability of this information may pose to you and your relatives. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your participation in this study and its potential risks, including the fact that not all of the risks are known, with your immediate family members.
• There are some risks that are currently very unlikely, but at least theoretically possible, from sharing your DNA sequence information online. For example, someone could synthesize strings of DNA from your data and place them at a crime scene in an attempt to implicate you. 
• Individuals under the age of 21 will not be allowed to participate in the study.

NEW INFORMATION 
Participants will be informed via the study website at http://weconsent.us about any new information that might change their decision to continue to be in this study.  You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.

BENEFITS
You are not likely to directly benefit in any way as a result of your participation in the creation of a Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort. The benefits will primarily be to society and to science at large.
The primary outputs of this study will be published, either in the traditional scientific literature or in newer forms such as blogs, wikis, software models of disease, and more. One of the Terms of Use that we will require of researchers is a commitment to publish their results under “Open Access” terms, which means that the outputs must be freely available on the public internet, permitting any users – including you – to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. This is not a direct benefit to you, but to science and society, but through this Open Access requirement you will at least be able to access and read the research emerging from the study without having to pay fees. 
This study does not entitle you to demand data return from a biosample you submit in the context of other clinical research, or of data from another study.

COSTS
There are no costs to participate in this study.

PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
You will not be compensated for your participation in the study. Neither you nor your heirs will receive financial or any other benefits from any discoveries, whether or not of a commercial nature, made using the information and/or specimens that you provide.

ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT 
This is not a treatment study.  Your alternative is not to participate in this study.

CONFIDENTIALITY 
Study information collected about you will be given to the sponsor.  “Sponsor” means any persons or companies that are working for or with the sponsor, or owned by the sponsor. It will also be given to qualified researchers, which means any persons who have agreed to be bound by a set of Terms and Conditions of Use in order to access and use your data for research purposes.

It may be given to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other governmental agencies in the US and other countries where the study may be considered for approval.  Medical records which identify you and the consent form signed by you may be looked at and/or copied for research or regulatory purposes by:

• The FDA,
• Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agencies,
• Governmental agencies in other countries, and
• Western Institutional Review Board® (WIRB®) or other Institutional Review Board.

Total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed because of the need to give information to these parties.  The results of this research study may be presented at meetings or in publications.  Your identity will not be given out during those presentations.

Why will this information be used and/or given to others?
• To create computational models of biology and disease
• To replicate studies
• To explore the connection between genomes, health, and disease

If the results of this study are made public, information that identifies you will not be used.
What if I decide not to give permission to use and give out my health information?
Then you will not be able to be in this research study.

May I review or copy my information?
Yes, at any time.

May I withdraw or revoke (cancel) my permission?
Your permission will not stop automatically.  It will expire in 2080.  You are free to decide at any time that you no longer want your data or other information to be used as part of this study. However, it may not be possible to prevent the future use of your data or other information in certain circumstances.
If you choose to withdraw from the study and request that your genetic and trait data be removed, you will send your Unique Identifier to the Principal Investigator and within 2 months we will delete all DNA sequence and trait data about you held in the updated Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data provided by you previously will not be included in future updates to the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database. 
However, once any data or information about you is posted to the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database, other organizations and individuals may acquire copies of it. There will be no way to ensure deletion of all existing copies of your data or information.  Researchers will be encouraged to use the most current version of the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database, but your data may be combined in ways that will make it impossible to delete them from all existing datasets.
Is my health information protected after it has been given to others?
There is a risk that your information will be given to others without your permission.
