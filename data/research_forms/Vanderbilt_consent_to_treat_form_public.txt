or can obtain a non-binding estimate prior, or subsequent, to signing this agreement.
I understand that some items or services that VUMC may provide to me may not be covered by my insurance

or service determined by my third party payor (my insurance company) to be experimental, investigational, or to be
non-covered for any other reason.
I understand that I am personally responsible for any non-covered Medicare, Medicaid, TennCare, or
TriCare/CHAMPUS items or services that are listed on the financial responsibility for non-covered items or services
form. I understand that I am personally responsible for deductibles and co-insurance established by my member
benefit agreement, including those required for in-network laboratory and other ancillary services or items.
I hereby agree that if VUMC has agreed to bill my insurance or other third-party carrier, it has agreed to do so as a
courtesy, and that VUMC has the right, should VUMC deem it advisable, to demand payment in full from me at any
time prior to full payment from any insurance or third-party carrier, unless VUMC and my insurance company or
third-party carrier have agreed that I will not be billed.
I understand and agree that I have been advised that I may be billed by VUMC and that this Assignment of Benefits
and Agreement to Pay applies to any and all VUMC physician services and both inpatient and outpatient VUMC
hospital accounts. If a delinquent account referred for collection, I agree to pay the reasonable attorney's fees, court
costs and/or collection agency fees associated with the collection process.

III

ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS
I hereby authorize and request all insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations or managed care
organizations with whom I have coverage, including TennCare, Medicare, Medicaid, and TriCare/CHAMPUS to
pay directly to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, including Vanderbilt University Hospital, Vanderbilt
University Children’s Hospital, the Vanderbilt Medical Group and the Psychiatric Hospital at Vanderbilt
(‘collectively VUMC’) any and all benefits due under the terms of my policy for items or services provided by
VUMC, including any settlements or judgments for such items or services. If my health insurance will not allow
direct payment to VUMC, I agree to immediately forward to VUMC all health insurance payments I receive for my
care and treatment at VUMC.
