FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY, CONTACT: (Protocol Director Name, address and phone number).   Only protocol directors or academic sponsors whose names appear on application cover page may be listed here.
DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study on (describe project in non-technical language; include types of questions that will be asked, if applicable; explain purpose of the research). You will be asked to (describe procedures; answer questions, take a survey, mention video/audio taping, if applicable, and what will become of tapes after use, e.g., shown at scientific meetings; describe the final disposition of the tapes).
The following language is recommended when samples of tissues, cells, blood, or body fluids (hereafter referred to as tissues) will be taken or banked for use in current or future research.  This includes testing the sample for purposes of collecting genetic or other information.  Investigators should choose the appropriate provisions to be included in their informed consent form and may vary any of the following language as appropriate.

Tissue Sampling for Research 
Research using tissues is an important way to try to understand human disease.  You have been given this information because the investigators want to include your tissues in a research project and because they want to save the samples for future research.  There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues to be studied.  
Your tissues will be stored (insert how samples will be stored - and if appropriate how samples will be linked) e.g., under diagnosis and medical record or code number and unlinked.   
If linked: You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be studied now or saved for future study.  You may withdraw from this study at any time.  The investigators might retain the identified samples, e.g., as part of your routine clinical care, but not for additional research. 

If unlinked: Because your samples will not be linked to your name after they are stored, you cannot withdraw your consent to the use of the samples after they are taken.  
 
Optional:
The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests. 
Or 
You will be told the results of tests that are part of your clinical care, but you will not be told the results of the research tests, including any future research tests. 

	_____ I consent to my samples being saved for future research

	_____ I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research

Include the following language if samples in study will be used for genetic testing or if future research on samples will include genetic testing.

Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing

As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators (may/will) do genetic testing.  Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment.  Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results.  Possible risks of knowing results include:  anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination.  A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. 

Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. 

If investigators will not share the research results with the participant, the following language can be added: 
The results of the study of your samples from this project will be used for research purposes only, and you will not be told the results of the tests. 

RISKS AND BENEFITS: #The risks associated with this study are (describe foreseeable risks or discomfort to subjects; if none, state as such).  The benefits which may reasonably be expected to result from this study are (describe any benefits; if none, state as such).  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  
If applicable:  Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment/medical care.
TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation in this experiment will take approximately (amount of time).
PAYMENTS: You will receive (describe reimbursement; where there is none, state as such) as payment for your participation. 
If participants will be paid, add the following:
Payments may only be made to U.S. citizens, legal resident aliens, and those who have a work eligible visa.  You may need to provide your social security number to receive payment.
 
PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 
The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.  However, your identity will not be disclosed.
If applicable: You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. 

Authorization To Use Your Health Information For Research Purposes 
State law requires that the HIPAA text be in at least 14-point type.
Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in this research study without your written authorization.

If I sign, can I revoke it or withdraw from the research later?
If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your health information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at any time.  After any revocation, your health information will no longer be used or disclosed in the study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using your information (e.g., necessary to maintain integrity of research).
