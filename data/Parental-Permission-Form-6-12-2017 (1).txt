INSTRUCTIONS
NO MORE THAN MINIMAL RISK 
Parental Permission TEMPLATE


Notice to all Users:
Use of the UMCIRB Parental Permission document template is mandatory.  A copy of the parental permission document must be given to the parent(s).  The research record should also reflect when a copy of the document is given to the parent(s).  

When using this template, the following are key issues:

> Items in [brackets and in purple] are instructions.  These must be replaced with specific information that fits your study.  Then all instructions must be removed before uploading the final document into the IRB application.  Any consent or assent documents submitted with these instructions left in will immediately be returned to the PI and will delay UMCIRB review.

> Items (sentences or phrases) that are in black are required information to be included in the Parental Permission document.

> All documents must be evaluated to ensure the reading level is no greater than sixth grade prior to uploading them into ePIRATE.  You need to write the consent with short sentences, paragraphs that are concise and do not use technical or professional terms.  If such terms must be used, then a description of that term must be included.

USING CHILDREN IN RESEARCH:
> Research that does not involve more than minimal risk only requires the signature of  one parent; 

> If the children are ages 12 and above, a separate Assent Form must be developed and presented to the IRB for consideration (or a request to waive such documentation);

> For children under 12 years of age, a script of what will be said to the child during the assent process should be submitted for review; 

> Procedures for obtaining assent from children should be considered in terms of their age (chronological and developmental) and the type of research.

> If the child is between the ages of 7 years and 12 years, verbal assent should be obtained from the child, whenever possible.  For children under the age of 7 years, verbal assent is not required but a brief explanation should be provided to the child as appropriate for his/her level of understanding.  Verbal assent can then be documented in the research records and as a note on the Parental Permission form with a statement such as:

"The parent and the person obtaining parental permission have determined that the child is too young or otherwise not able to document assent."    _________Parent/Guardian     _________Person Obtaining Parental Permission.



ADDITIONAL UMCIRB REQUIREMENTS:  Listed below are important points to follow when constructing a Parental Permission document:
1. All Parental Permission documents must be understandable to the parents.  Likewise, all assent documents should be written at an age level appropriate for the population being recruited.  All scientific, medical and technical terms should be defined or explained.  

2. If you need help finding the right language for the Parental Permission or assent document, ORIC has a Glossary of Lay Terms on its website: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-acad/ORIC/irb/upload/Glossary-of-Lay-Terms.pdf or you can call the ORIC at 252-744-2914 for assistance.  

3. The template uses a question/answer format with the participant asking the question (headings) and your response in first person below that heading.  Refer to the parent (Parental Permission) and child (Assent) as "you" and the researchers as "I" or "we".
* Use the term research or research study throughout the consent.  Do not use the terms "treatment" or "therapy".
* Use short sentences, non-technical terms, and no undefined abbreviations or acronyms.  
* Consent title must match exactly the title of the research protocol.  The title of the Parental Permission and Assent must match the title of the application submitted to the UMCIRB, unless a request to waive this requirement is made (along with an explanation of why this is being requested).
* Use element headings and margins as designated by the template.  Allow for "white space" borders with generous margins.  This makes the document easier to read and understand.  
* Use large font type to improve readability, consider an 11 size font or larger.  Make sure you use the same font throughout the document.
* Make sure you include the footer as provided in the template and the page number with the total number of pages on each page (Page 1 of 5, 2 of 5, etc.).  The version date or number of the consent document will improve the tracking of document changes with amendments or revisions to the protocol.  Most sponsored research studies will provide a version date or number for the consent document.  In a non-sponsored study, the investigator may choose the initial submission date or Number 1, and then correlate version dates or numbers with each submitted change. 
* Perform spell and grammar check on the informed consent document, as well as reading carefully to identify correctly spelled words that are used incorrectly.

GENERAL INFORMATION, COMMENTS AND HELPFUL HINTS:
The investigator must reveal any conflicts of interest.  If there is a conflict of interest as identified in the UMCIRB Conflict of Interest Disclosure form, then additional language may need to be inserted into the parental permission document as a part of the conflict of interest management plan.

If the following scenario applies to your research, you must include the language provided, as applicable:

Statement when there is a conflict of interest 
"The Principal Investigator (or the sub-investigator, research staff member, or family member) has a potential conflict of interest that involves (provide a brief description of the conflict).  (ECU, institution's name or office name) and (name or title of person with conflict) have developed a management plan to minimize any negative impact that would otherwise occur from the potential conflict of interest.  This plan has been reviewed by the University & Medical Center Institutional Review Board and found to be adequate to protect your rights."



DOCUMENTED VALID CONSENT
Investigators should complete the initial informed consent process with the IRB approved consent document that has the IRB approval and expiration date stamped on each page. It should be noted in the research record when the parental permission form was given to the parent(s).  Also, it should be documented in the research record that informed consent conversation that occurs at each subsequent visit.

REQUESTING WAIVER OF SOME OR ALL ELEMENTS OF INFORMED CONSENT
An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 45 CFR 46, or waive the requirements to obtain informed consent provided the IRB can justify and documents that:
(1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the participants;
(2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants; 
(3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and 
(4) whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. 

A specified request must be submitted for the UMCIRB to consider waiver or alteration of informed consent.  This request must be submitted in the Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent section of the IRB application.
