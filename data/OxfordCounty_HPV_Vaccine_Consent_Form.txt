HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE

   

FOR GRADE 8 GIRLS

FACTS

What are the problems with HPV?
HPV is short for Human Papillomavirus. The virus
is spread by sexual skin to skin contact. HPV can
cause genital warts and cancer (cervical, anal,
genital, mouth and throat). Each year in Ontario,
HPV results in about

- 254 deaths

- 1090 cancers

- 14666 cases ofgenital warts1

What is the benefit of getting the
vaccine?

In research, the vaccine protects 100% against the
4 main types of HPV.2 Two shots are needed to
provide protection to females age 9-14. Studies
are being done to find out ifa boosterwill be
needed.

How is the vaccine tested?
The vaccine has been in use since 2006. Safety is
tested:
- before new vaccines are approved in Canada
- before each batch of vaccine is released
- through lab inspections
- through ongoing research
- through reports of adverse events

What is an adverse event?

An adverse event is any health problem after the
vaccine is given. The event may or may not be due
to the vaccine. When things happen close together,
it does not mean they are related. For example, if
you eat an apple and then break your arm, it does
not mean the apple caused the bone to break.

What are the side effects of the vaccine?
All injections can cause pain in the muscle, redness
or swelling. Headache and feeling tired are the
main side effects ofthe vaccine.3

vaccines. The HPV vaccine is not required by law

if you decide not to vaccinate.

The vaccine is free for girls in grade 8. Girls up to
grade 12 can get the vaccine for free ifthey miss

the grade 8 doses. If you decide to wait, the total
cost ofthe vaccine is about $405.
