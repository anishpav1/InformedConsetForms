CONSENT FOR ROOT
CANAL TREATMENT
I hereby authorize

Patient name

and any associates

Doctor name

to perform a root canal on tooth/teeth number(s): ___________________________________________________

The doctor has explained to me that the purpose of
this procedure is to retain teeth that may otherwise
have to be extracted. The doctor has explained to
me the treatment and the anticipated results of the
treatment. I understand that this is an elective
procedure and that there are alternative treatments,
and the doctor has explained the risks and benefits
of the alternatives. I also understand that root canal
therapy has a very high success rate, but the doctor
has not guaranteed or warranted a perfect result.

2.

Infection that may occur and may continue,
requiring further endodontic surgery or
extraction.

3.

Fracture or breakage of the root or crown
portion during or after treatment.

4.

Inadvertent breakage of files or instruments
within the root canal system that are unable
to be retrieved.

The doctor has explained to me that there are
certain potential risks in the procedure. These
include:

5.

Perforation of the tooth during treatment.

6.

Damage to existing fillings, crowns, or
porcelain veneers.

7.

______________________________________

1.

Inability to completely fill the root canal
because the canal is calcified or has a unique
curvature. This may require endodontic
surgery or extraction of the tooth.

______________________________________

Unforeseen conditions may arise that require a
procedure that is different than set forth above or
a referral to a specialist. I authorize the doctor
and any associates to perform such procedures
when in their professional judgment, the procedures are necessary.
I understand that the medications, drugs, anesthetics, and prescriptions taken for this procedure
may cause drowsiness and lack of awareness and

coordination. I further understand that drugs and
anesthetics may cause unanticipated reactions,
which might require medical treatment. I also
understand that I should not consume alcohol or
other drugs because they can increase these
effects. I have been advised not to work and not to
operate any vehicle or machinery until I have fully
recovered from the effects of the medications.

Please do not hesitate to ask the doctor or the
staff if you have any questions.
