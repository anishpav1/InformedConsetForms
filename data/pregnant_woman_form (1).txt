CPHS - RESEARCH INVOLVING PREGNANT WOMEN, FETUSES AND NEONATES
Please complete: CPHS#                  PI: 
If you are completing this form on a Mac, indicate your answer to any checkboxes by bolding or highlighting, or by deleting any incorrect options.    


The questions below reflect the regulatory conditions contained in 45 CFR 46 Subpart B.

1. Research involving Pregnant Women and Human Fetuses:

a. Does this research pose a greater than minimal risk to the:
Woman ☐  No		☐  Yes  
Fetus ☐  No		☐  Yes  

If either is yes, explain:



b. Does the research hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the:

Woman ☐  No		☐  Yes
Fetus ☐  No		☐  Yes

c. For research that does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit to the fetus, explain how the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by any other means. 


d. Where scientifically appropriate, have preclinical studies, including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on nonpregnant women, been conducted to provide data for assessing potential risks to pregnant women and fetuses?  Yes No 
Explain: 


e. Explain why the level of risk is the least possible for achieving the objectives of the research and provide justification for your explanation: 


f. Describe how you will ensure that individuals providing consent are fully informed regarding the reasonably foreseeable impact of the research on the fetus:  




NOTE: if the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely to the fetus, then the consent of the pregnant woman and the father must be obtained, except that the father's consent need not be obtained if he is unable to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Otherwise, the consent of the mother is sufficient.

g. Check off that the Principal Investigator assures that:
☐ No inducements, monetary or otherwise, will be offered to terminate a pregnancy;
☐  Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in any decisions as to the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy; and
☐ Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining the viability of a neonate.

2. Research involving Neonates:

Regulatory Definitions:
Neonate means a newborn.
Nonviable neonate means a neonate after delivery that, although living, is not viable.
Viable, as it pertains to the neonate, means being able, after delivery, to survive (given the benefit of available medical therapy) to the point of independently maintaining heartbeat and respiration. 

Have the neonates eligible for participation in this study been determined to be viable?
☐  No	☐  Yes	☐  Uncertain	

If yes, the neonates are subject to the regulations for the involvement of children in research studies.  Please complete the Research Involving Children form.

If uncertain or no, please answer the following questions:

a. Where scientifically appropriate, have preclinical and clinical studies been conducted to provide data for assessing potential risks to neonates?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


b. The Principal Investigator assures that individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining the viability of the neonate: 
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


c. Is the purpose of the research the development of important biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means and will there be no added risk to the neonate as a result of the research?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 



d. Will there be any added risk to the neonate resulting from the research?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


e. Does the research hold out the prospect of enhancing the probability of survival of the neonate to the point of viability, and is any risk the least possible for achieving that objective? 
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


f. Will legally effective informed consent from either parent* be obtained in the case of a neonate of uncertain viability?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 



Respond to g through i only if the study involves neonates that have been determined to be nonviable independently from the investigator. 

g. Will legally effective informed consent from both parents* be obtained in the case of  nonviable neonates?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


h. Will vital functions of the neonate be artificially maintained? 
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 


i. Will the research terminate the heartbeat or respiration of the neonate?  
☐  No		☐  Yes

Explain: 



*The legally effective informed consent of either parent may be waived because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, in which case the legally effective informed consent of either parent's legally authorized representative is obtained in accord with subpart A of CFR 45 part 46, except that the consent of the father or his legally authorized representative need not be obtained if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
