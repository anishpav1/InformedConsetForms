INFORMAT IONAL USE ONLY

ENDOD ONTIC (Root Canal Therapy)
INFORMED CONSENT
I hereby consent to the endodontic treatment procedure for myself (or my child _____________)
on tooth number(s) ________________ to be performed by Dr. __________________________.
I understand the nature of the problem causing the need for treatment (that the nerve tissue within
the toot h is dead or dying and causing acute or potential risk of infection in the bone surrounding
the tooth), and I understand the reasons for treatment (removal of the nerve tissue to relieve or
prevent infection). The alternative treatment of extraction of the tooth has been explained to me
as well as t he po tential consequences if no treatment is performed. I also understand the po ssible
risks of not completing this treatment once it is begun.
I understand that during or after endodontic treatment there is a possibility the following may
occur: pain, swelling, infection, reinfection, cold sores, canker sores, irritation or injury to the oral
tissues, periodontal involvement (bone loss and tooth mobility due to infection), calcified canals
preventing complete endodontic therapy, allergic reactions to dental material or medications,
breakage of instruments (such as files) within the root canal or perforation of the crown or root of
the tooth (by dental instruments or as a pre-existing condition) which may require surgical
correction or result in the loss of the toot h.
I understand that root canal therapy is not always successful (approximately 90-95% of cases are
treated successfully) and that the endodontic procedure may have to be repeated and/or an
additional surgical procedure may be required at additional expense. I understand that the
treatment may involve several appointments to complete, and I may loose this tooth despite all
efforts to save it.
I understand that after endodontic treatment, the tooth will be more brittle, may discolor (possibly
requiring bleaching or veneering), and will require restorative treatment (filling, post, buildup,
and/or crown), and I have been given and estimate of fees for the completion of this work.
Failure to complete this restorative treatment may result in the loss of the tooth due to fracture. I
have been given the opportunity to ask questions and have received satisfactory answers. I am
aware that the practice of Dentistry and Endodontics is not an exact science, and I acknowledge
that no guarantees have been made to me as a result of the procedure authorized above.
