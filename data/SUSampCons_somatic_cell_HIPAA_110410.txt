PURPOSE OF RESEARCH

You are invited to participate in a research study involving the donation of somatic cells.  Somatic cells make up most of the body's tissues and organs such as the blood, brain, liver, or skin.  In this study, (state what is being studied, along with an explanation of what stem cells are being used and why they are useful.  Please include a description of Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer research if applicable.   We hope to learn (state what the study is designed to discover or establish).  

This research study is looking for (state number of people) participants with (disease or condition, if applicable).  (If controls are to be a part of the project, state how many will be recruited.) (Clarify if enrollment will occur throughout the United States or internationally.)  Stanford University expects to enroll (state number) research study participants.

You were selected as a possible participant in this study because (state why the participant was selected.  If both test subjects and controls are to be used, explain to which category the individual being consented belongs).



DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT 

This research study is expected to take approximately (x days, weeks, months, etc.) e.g., If you decide to enter the study, your active participation will be less than one day.  We estimate that the overall length of the study including analyses of data will be five years.
* If there is a follow-up period, state so and the expected length of time.


PROCEDURES

This consent form is an invitation for you to provide (fill in type of cells and/or tissue that will be used and how they will be obtained).  If you choose to participate, Protocol Director and (his/her) research study staff will (describe all procedures to be followed).  Consider inserting a chart or calendar; these images can be very helpful to participants.  Chronological descriptions are also helpful.  Use lay terminology throughout. 

PD should describe in detail
* How often each procedure will be done and how long it is expected to take.  Provide detailed description of procedures to be used to obtain the tissue, e.g. skin, fat cells, blood cells, cheek cells, etc.
* Specify both invasive and non-invasive procedures.
* Specify if any procedures would be done whether or not the participant enrolls in the research, i.e., whether procedures are standard of care or being done solely for research purposes.

Example of skin biopsy description:

We will ask for a skin sample from you.  The skin sample is obtained by a process called a "punch biopsy".  In this procedure, a small area of skin on the thigh or arm is thoroughly cleaned and injected with xylocaine, a local anesthetic.  When the skin is numb, a small round blade of three millimeters (one-eighth of an inch) in diameter is pressed into the skin, creating a circular cut approximately one eighth inch deep.  This round piece of skin is then removed, pressure is applied to stop bleeding and the resulting hole in the skin covered with a sterile bandage.  In some cases one or two stitches are required to close the wound.  The xylocaine anesthetic may sting for several seconds during the injection; afterwards, the punch biopsy should cause no discomfort.  The biopsy takes about ten minutes to perform, including time for cleaning and preparation.  The wound usually heals within three days.  A punch biopsy will result in minor scarring at the biopsy site.  We will only ask once for a punch biopsy.

* If samples will be sent out of Stanford for analysis or other purposes, include a statement:  
* Your samples will be sent outside of Stanford for (explain purpose). 
* If samples, such as tissues or blood, will not be saved at the end of the study add the following:  
*Any samples left over when the study is completed will not be saved for future research. 
* If samples will be saved for future research, see Tissue Sampling for Future Use text.   


DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH

The following language is recommended when samples of tissues, cells, blood, or body fluids (hereafter referred to as tissues) will be donated or banked for use in current or future stem cell research.  Investigators should choose the appropriate provisions to be included in their informed consent form and may vary any of the following language as appropriate.

Explain the following:
* where the work will be conducted
* the types of experiments that will be performed
* whether new cell lines will be established and how they will be used. 
* Indicate that the cells may multiply indefinitely.

The following example is provided:

Most stem cell research begins with the establishment of new stem cell lines.  There are several ways to make these lines.  One way is to derive stem cell lines by using cells in tissues taken from the body, such as blood, adipose (or fat) tissue, or skin.  It is possible that these stem cell lines, which can live indefinitely, may contain all or part of your DNA.  Stem cell lines from tissues can usually be made without changing the genetic information by artificial means.

Another way of making stem cell lines is to introduce certain genes into somatic cells and "reprogram" them to become pluripotent, or able to become any cell in the body, such as brain, liver, or heart cells.  Such cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells. 

In this study (describe stem cell work)

Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer research should additionally include information about SCNT and/or Genetic Reprogramming.  Individuals must initial and date their consent to use their somatic cells for SCNT and/or Genetic Reprogramming.  An example can be found below:

Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT).  SCNT removes the nucleus from a human egg, which contains the donor's genetic material (DNA), and replaces it with the nucleus from your somatic cell.  The egg with the new nucleus can then be stimulated to divide.

Genetic Reprogramming. Certain genes may be put into your skin cells to study how the cells can be changed, or reprogrammed, into embryonic-like cells.

Stem cell lines may be made from each of the methods described above.  Cells multiply by dividing in two, and the genetic material is replicated every time a cell divides.  It is possible that these lines, which can live indefinitely, may contain all or part of your DNA. 

Any cell lines created may be kept for many years and may be used in further studies, by researchers at Stanford or other researchers and entities outside of Stanford, which cannot be predicted at the present time.  They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. 

It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There are no restrictions on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products.

_______
Initials
______
Date

I consent to donate my somatic cells to be used for Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer and/or Genetic Reprogramming (which may result in the production of stem cell lines) with no restrictions on future uses outlined in this consent. 
* You should be aware that your tissues, cells or other materials derived from these tissues may be kept for many years and may be used by researchers at Stanford or by researchers at entities outside of Stanford in future studies, which are not foreseeable now.  They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. 

* It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals.  There can be no restrictions placed on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products, except in the case where donation is intended for autologous transplantation (when you, the donor, would also be the recipient).

The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes and tissue derivatives may also be used in human therapies. 


TISSUE SAMPLING FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Research using tissues is important for understanding human disease.  You have been given this information because the investigators want to include your tissues in this research project and because they want to save the samples for future research.  
Your tissues will be stored (insert how samples will be stored - and if appropriate, how samples will be linked e.g., medical record or code number and unlinked). 
If samples are linked to individually identifiable information:  You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be saved for future study.  The investigators might retain the identified samples, e.g., as part of your routine clinical care, but not for additional research. 

If samples are unlinked to individually identifiable information:  Because your samples will not be linked to your name after they are stored, you cannot withdraw your consent to the use of the samples after they are unlinked. 

If samples will be used for SCNT:  You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be studied now or saved for future study.  Your tissues may be stored in liquid nitrogen indefinitely.  However, once the skin biopsy is provided to researchers, you may not be able to withdraw them from the research because they would be processed for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), and/or genetic reprogramming research immediately for the derivation of stem cell lines.  If you choose to withdraw your tissue from being studied now or saved for future study you will not be able to participate in this research study. 

Any tissues you have donated which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries.  In some instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the Investigators, Stanford University and/or others.  By consenting to participate, you authorize use of your tissues or samples for the research described above and understand that there are no plans to provide you with compensation or a share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.
If you agree to participate, investigators in this study may wish to re-contact you in the future to ask about your health status, in order to include that information with your tissue.
* I consent to being re-contacted in the future should the investigators wish to ask for additional health information. 

   Initials ______________   Date ______________    


* I do not consent to being re-contacted in the future should the investigators wish to ask for additional health information.

As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators may do genetic testing.  Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.  Genetic research may also include genetically modifying cells that are derived from your tissues to better understand how genes function.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications, and responses to treatment.  
Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. 
The tissue will be used primarily by researchers at Stanford University.  However, there may also be collaborative efforts with other universities, the government, and private companies.  Future research will need to be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Stem Cell Research Oversight (SCRO) Panel, which oversees human research and stem cell research at Stanford.   
* Any tissues you have donated which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries.  In some instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by the investigators, Stanford University and/or others.  By consenting to participate, you authorize use of your tissues or samples for the research described above and understand that there are no plans to provide you with compensation or a share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.

* You must be given the opportunity to impose restrictions on future uses of donated materials.  However, researchers may choose to use materials only from donors who agree to all future uses without restriction.
	I consent to my samples (name tissue) being saved for future research
     No restrictions.
     Restrictions (Please specify):_______________________________________
  I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research.


PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES          

As a participant, your responsibilities include: (Include only those that are applicable.)

* Follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.
* Keep your study appointments.  If it is necessary to miss an appointment, please contact the Protocol Director or research study staff to reschedule as soon as you know you will miss the appointment.
* Tell the Protocol Director or research study staff about any side effects, doctor visits, or hospitalizations that you may have.
* Complete your questionnaires as instructed. 
* Ask questions as you think of them.
* Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study.


WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY

* If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue your participation at any time. 

* You have the right to refuse to allow your tissues to be studied now or saved for future study; however you cannot withdraw derivatives and other products made from cells isolated from that tissue once they have been distributed, reprogrammed or incorporated into other cells or cellular materials. 

If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify (specify contact and telephone number). Clearly outline the study withdrawal procedures.

The Protocol Director may also withdraw you from the study, without your consent for one or more of the following reasons:  
* Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.
* The investigator decides that continuing your participation could be harmful to you.
* You need treatment not allowed in the study.
* The study is cancelled. 
* An administrative reason as determined by the investigator.
* Unanticipated circumstances.

POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES 

There are possible risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study.  These deserve careful thought.  You should talk with the Protocol Director if you have any questions.
* Describe the discomforts and inconveniences reasonably expected; include the inconvenience of travel.
* Describe any reasonably foreseeable risks - include for example
o Physical risks - from study medications and procedures (e.g., venipuncture, exposure to radiation, allergic reaction when treatment includes medication)  

The following is an example of risks associated with skin biopsy:

You will also be asked to provide a skin biopsy.  In spite of all precautions, you might develop medical complications from the skin biopsy.  There is less than one percent chance of local infection or serious bleeding as a result of the punch biopsy.  In the unlikely event that this should occur, it is easily treated and you will be given access to prompt medical attention.
 
Another risk is an allergic reaction due to the local anesthetic applied.  It will be very important to let the doctor know whether you have any allergies, especially allergies to any medications.

Also, you may experience discomfort, bruising, and/or bleeding at the site where the needle is inserted.  Sometimes people get dizzy or feel faint.  If you have had a history of feeling faint when your blood is drawn and/or an injection is given, please let the doctor know before he/she begins the skin biopsy.  

We will also ask you to travel to Stanford to have the skin biopsy done, which may be inconvenient for you.  We will attempt to schedule appointments at times that minimize loss of your time.  If the doctor needs to close the wound with stitches; you may have to return to Stanford to have the stitches removed.

* Include a statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject, which are currently unforeseeable. 
While every effort will be made to protect your identity and health information, there is always a small risk of loss of privacy.  Your identity will be kept as confidential as possible as required by law. 

POTENTIAL BENEFITS                             

* Describe any benefits that may be reasonably expected (key word-"reasonably").  If none can be expected, state so as follows:

* WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE OR PROMISE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM THIS STUDY.

* For SCNT Research include the following:
o This research is not intended to provide direct medical benefit to you or anyone else.  Cell lines that are derived may not be available for your treatment in the future.  You may not receive any information about subsequent research, or study results using your donated materials.  Additionally, donated somatic cells will not be available for your treatment in the future.  Your participation will potentially further scientific and medical knowledge and may lead to disease treatments in the future.  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. 

ALTERNATIVES
* The alternative to participating in this study is to not participate.  

PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS

CONFIDENTIALITY

An example of the confidentiality disclosure from a specific study is shown below:
In this study, we ask to have access to limited medical information along with the tissue sample being donated.  This information would be used to (describe the experimental procedure).  If you already are a Stanford patient, information related to your donated tissue will be maintained in your medical record.  If you do not have a Stanford medical record, one will be created for you.  The privacy and confidentiality of Stanford medical records is protected in accordance with the Privacy Notice, which you will receive separately.
# Your identity and/or your personal health information will not be disclosed except as authorized by you or as required by law.  However, there is always some risk that even de-identified information might be re-identified.
 If you plan to re-contact participants, state how this will be done. 
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
Authorization to Use Your Health Information for 
Research Purposes

State law requires that the HIPAA text be in at least 14-point type.
Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in this research study without your written authorization.  If you sign this form, it will provide that authorization.  The form is intended to inform you about how your identifiable health information will be used or disclosed in the study.  Your information will only be used in accordance with this authorization form and the informed consent form and as required or allowed by law.  Please read it carefully before signing it.  

What is the purpose of this research study and how will my identifiable health information be utilized in the study?

The purpose of this research study is to (describe purpose of study).  The medical personnel obtaining the (describe tissues) will keep a record of your name and personal health information.  Information related to your tissue sample will be noted in your existing medical record, and if you do not yet have a medical record at Stanford, one will be created to record this information.  The study coordinator will assign a code to any identifiable information before sending cells to the other researchers, who will use only coded (not directly identifiable) health information to derive and analyze stem cell lines.  Your coded health information, such as age, medical conditions, type of clinical treatment, and treatment outcomes, may be analyzed together with the data that are generated from your donated tissue.  
No personal information will be disclosed to anyone other than research staff involved in this study.  No identifying personal information will be disclosed in written or verbal reports of research results.
Under current law, any future research study that wishes to use your health information with any direct or indirect identifiers generally requires another, separate authorization form signed by you at that time.  There are some limited exceptions from that requirement.  Both now and in the future, release of identifying information would occur only to the extent and under the conditions specified by law.  

Do I have to sign this authorization form?

You do not have to sign this authorization form.  But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.  Signing the form is not a condition for receiving any medical care outside the study.

If I sign, can I revoke it or withdraw from the research later?

If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your health information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at any time.  After any revocation, your health information will no longer be used or disclosed in the study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using your information (e.g., necessary to maintain integrity of research).  If you wish to revoke your authorization for the research use or disclosure of your health information in this study, you must write to (researcher's name and address).

What Identifiable Health Information Will Be Used or Disclosed?

As explained above, certain identifiable health information related to this study will be maintained in a medical record, and used or disclosed as permitted by the Privacy Notice that you separately will receive or as required by law.  Identifiable health information related to this study will also be maintained by the study coordinator and used or disclosed in accordance with the consent form.  

The study coordinator will replace your name and other identifiable information with a code so that researchers deriving and analyzing stem cell lines are able to use health information that is relevant to the study, without information that specifically identifies you. 

It is possible that identifying health information may be disclosed for legal or oversight purposes.
