NOTES to Informed Consent Authors: 

This template contains DF/HCC recommended language for informed consent documents.  Informed consent authors should avoid changing this text except where it is not relevant or appropriate to a specific protocol.
* Model text for use in the informed consent form is in black text.  In most cases the black text should be retained when adapting the template to a specific protocol.  However, for some types of studies, the language may not be appropriate. If you have questions about the applicability of text in this template, please contact the Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) at (617) 632-3029.
* Instructions and examples for informed consent authors are in [brackets and italics].  A blank line, ______, is used where the information to be inserted is clear. 
* The term "research doctor" has been used throughout the template because the Principal Investigator of a cancer treatment trial is a physician.  If this template is used for a trial where the Principal Investigator is not a physician, another appropriate term should be used instead of "research doctor".
* Once completed, please delete all instructions, i.e., blue text - these statements are provided for guidance to consent writers only.  After deleting instructions, please review the consent form for proper formatting and eliminate orphan heading (i.e., where the heading is printed by itself at the bottom of a page and the text follows on the next page).
* OPTIONAL STUDIES: Whenever possible, the IRB prefers that the optional studies be incorporated into the main consent under a separate section. Each optional studies section should include a separate section for the participant's initials and the date. This initial/signature section should be placed after the privacy section and before the assent/consent documentation sections.
* COMBINATION PHASE STUDIES (e.g. Phase I/II): Generally, the IRB will review separate consent forms for each phase of the study.  Only the consent form for the phase that is open needs be submitted.  Please contact OHRS if both the Phase I and Phase II portions will be open to enrollment concurrently.
* PHASE I and NON-TREATMENT STUDIES: Please do not use the word "treatment" when referring to the "study drug." Please use "study drug," "study agent," "study drug administration," etc. as appropriate.
* TISSUE COLLECTIONS/OWNERSHIP: If the protocol involves the collection of tissue, where appropriate, please include the following statement, "If participation in this protocol involves providing a specimen of your tissue, please know that if the investigator leaves the institution, the research and the tissue might remain at the DF/HCC or might be transferred to another institution."
* SHARING TISSUE/DATA WITH COMMERCIAL ENTITIES: When sending the data or tissue with commercial entities, please make sure that the protocol states with whom identified and de-identified information will be shared. 
If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 18 years old, the word "you" refers to your child.  You, the parent, will be asked to read and sign this document to give permission for your child to participate.  [Delete this paragraph if the study involves adults only.]

* Please also make sure to define the length of a cycle in days or weeks.
* Specific instructions about how to take the drug, vomited and missed doses, etc., should not be included in the consent form but should be included in a separate drug diary.]  

[For dose escalation studies, insert the following:]  Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have [insert disease name], not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug.  The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses. 

[For randomized studies, insert the following:] Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be "randomized" into one of the study groups: ____ [describe the groups]. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin.  Neither you nor the research doctor will choose what group you will be in. [If blinded include the following: "Neither you nor the research doctor will know what group you are in."]  You will have a ____ [equal/one in three/etc.] chance of being placed in any of the following groups: 

[Describe each study group, for example:

[If applicable, include the following information here: Please explain whether the study drug will or will not be available after the study ends.] 

Sometimes it is hard to keep track of all of the details and procedures that are part of a research study.  We will describe them in this consent form and you can refer to this at any time during the research study.

If a drug diary will be given please include the following: If you take part in this research study you will be given a drug diary.  You will be asked to document information in the drug diary about the study treatment you are being asked to take.

If a study calendar will be given, please include the following: If you take part in this research study you will be given a study calendar.  Information about what to expect during and between study visits will be included in the study calendar.


[If applicable, include information about any study visits that may be excessively long especially if the visit will be more than several hours and/or require an overnight stay.]  


Before the research starts (screening):  
After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study.  Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study.  If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated.  

[List all screening tests and procedures, using a bulleted format, for example:]
* A medical history, which includes questions about your health, current medications, and any allergies.
* Performance status, which evaluates how you are able to carry on with your usual activities. 
* An assessment of your tumor by one or more of the following standard assessment tools: X-ray, CT (Computerized Tomography) scan, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans
* Blood tests. 
* Urine test.
* [add additional tests as appropriate (e.g. DCE-MRI (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans].

If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment.  If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.


Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening but not required to determine eligibility:  
[This section typically lists the procedures that must be completed before registration, but are not procedures to determine eligibility - if not applicable, please delete section.]
* Blood tests, [if appropriate: including baseline tests so that we can measure any additional effect of the study drug and disease status], [and/or if appropriate add: or to look for a marker for your particular type of cancer.] 
* Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples: PK blood samples to monitor how your body absorbs and breaks down the study drug.  Each blood sample will be approximately ___ teaspoon.
* HIV tests, [if appropriate: You will have blood samples (about 2 tablespoons) taken to test for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).  The purpose of this routine laboratory test is to determine whether the virus that is associated with Acquired Immune Deficiency (AIDS) that harms the immune system is present in your blood.  The results of these tests will appear in your medical record and will be shared with health care workers involved in your care.  The test results will be shared with the study sponsor(s), its subcontractors and/or its agents to perform functions relating to the conduct of this research.  All positive results will be shared with a health authority (e.g., the State Department of Health) as required by law.]

Planned Follow-up: 
[Explain the follow-up procedures.  For example: We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life.  We would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing.  Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at the long-term effects of the research study.].  


E. HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?

You will be in this research study for about [estimated length of time].  
[Or - you will be on the study treatment for about _________ [e.g., 6 months] and be followed for __________. [e.g., 3 years]]

The research doctor may decide to take you off the research study for many reasons including if:
* It is considered to be in your best interest
* The study treatment or procedures are found to be unsafe or ineffective
* There is any problem with following study treatments and procedures
* Your condition worsens
* A decision is made to close the study
* Or for other unforeseen reasons that make it necessary to stop your participation in the research study

If you are removed from the research study, the research doctor will explain to you why you were removed.  [Include, if appropriate what will happen if the participant is removed from the study, e.g. "The research doctor and research team will help arrange for your continued care.  If you are removed from the research study, you may be followed for up to one year.  You may continue on study treatment in the extension phase of the research study, if your research doctor determines that you are showing evidence of clinical benefit from the treatment."]  

In addition, you can stop participating in the research study at any time, however, the FDA requires that any information collected up to the point of your withdrawal cannot be removed from the study.  If you decide to stop participating in this research study, we encourage you to talk to the research doctor and your primary doctor first.


F. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS OF THE RESEARCH STUDY?

[There is specific language that must be included in consent forms for research that involves gene transfer and retroviral drugs. The institutional biosafety offices will provide this language.]

[Standard language - use only when appropriate for the study:]  There are risks to taking part in any research study. One risk is that you may get a study drug [for dose escalating studies include: or study dose of a drug] that does not help treat your disease or that makes your condition or disease worse.  Another risk is that there may be side effects.  

All cancer treatments can have side effects, which can range from mild and reversible to severe, long lasting and possibly life-threatening.  There is a great deal of variability among side effects of different cancer treatments and between individuals.  In a research study, all of the risks or side effects may not be known before you start the study. You need to tell your doctor or a member of the study team immediately if you experience any side effects. 

Everyone in the research study will be watched carefully for side effects.  You will be monitored during the administration of study drugs to keep track of your blood counts and organ function, particularly your kidney and liver function.  If you experience side effects, they may go away after you stop taking the study drug.  Some side effects can be mild; but others can be long lasting and may never go away.  Some may be life-threatening or fatal. 

Since the effect of the study drug(s) taken with other medications may not be known, it is important that you tell the research doctor about all prescription and non-prescription drugs, herbal preparations and nutritional supplements that you are taking or planning to take. There may also be some foods that you should avoid while on this research study and your research doctor will review this information with you.

During the research study, you will be notified of newly discovered side effects or significant findings, which may affect your health or willingness to participate.  You may be asked to sign a new consent form that shows that you have been informed of new information relating to this research study.

[List the side effects using lay language in the categories below according to the likelihood of occurrence. 
* Indicate what the side effect means for the participant (e.g., abnormal blood tests showing liver damage which is usually reversible when the drug is stopped or dose reduced). 
* Give information on the reversibility of the side effect.  
* Do not use symbols like "<" or ">".  Instead use the terms "less than" or "greater than" or whatever is most appropriate for the symbol being replaced.
* Please format the bullets under each risk using lay terminology. Please avoid using technical medical terms unless they are the term used in speaking with subjects (in which case the term can be listed in parentheses following the lay language description.
* Please do not include information that will become out of date or need to be updated.  For example, instead of stating "Of the thirty individuals who have received this drug to date, ten have experienced the following side effects..." please generally state: "The following side effects have been experienced by individuals who have received this drug:" Similarly, instead of stating "one participant experienced xyz...", please include these risks under the rare risks.
* Please refer to the Common Risk Language Database available at the OHRS website for lay terminology: www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/ohrs and look under "New Submissions."
* If there are required interventions associated with the administration of the study drug, then those risks should also be included. For example, if the administration of the study drug requires the placement of a central line, then include those risks. 

NOTE for Cooperative Group Trials Only: (i.e., CALGB, ECOG, CTSU, NABTT, COG, etc.) Highly recommend presenting the risks as set forth in the model consent document and not cutting and pasting those risks into the format below. You may use your discretion in deciding whether to simply use the risk format in the cooperative group model consent. This often is both the most straightforward way to handle this, avoids potentially missing toxicities that are essential to include for cooperative groups and will be easier to maintain with future amendments. Please note that similar or related risks may be consolidated into one bullet and risks should always be presented using lay terminology that is meaningful to participants. 

NOTE for Phase I Trials: Where known, the percentages, grouped as outlined below, should be used to categorize risks associated with drugs used in the trial.  Also, if first in man consider including a statement that not all risks are known.

Additionally, if this is a dose escalation study, please include a statement such as the following:  "One risk is that you may get a dose of the study drug that does not help treat your disease or that makes your condition or disease worse.  Another risk is that there may be side effects."

NOTE for Phase II and III Trials: Percentages should be used to categorize risks associated with drugs in Phase II and Phase III trials. As a guideline, "likely" risks are those occurring in greater than 50% of patients; "frequent" in 10-50% of participants; "occasional" in 1-10%; and "rare" in less than 1%. However, if the exact percentages are not known, then the terms likely, frequent, occasional, and rare can be used without including the associated percentage categories. You should be sure to identify those side effects that may be "serious." Serious is defined as side effects that may require hospitalization or may be irreversible, long-term, life threatening or fatal.

NOTE re what risks to include: Please list risks for the following:
* Risks associated with the investigational drug, device or biologic
* Risks associated with drugs or combination of drugs being evaluated as part of the study regardless of whether they are used on or off label
* Risks associated with any procedures that will be performed only as part of the research (i.e., the procedures would not be conducted if the participant were not participating in the study)
* Risks associated with any procedures required to administer the drugs, e.g., placement of a central line. ]

Risks Associated with [Study Intervention Name]:
Likely [If applicable, add: (More than a 50% chance that this will happen)]
* [List risks using a bulleted format with the most significant risks listed first. Make sure that you use lay language to describe a risk.]

Frequent [If applicable, add: (Between a 10-50% chance that this will happen)]   
* [List risks using a bulleted format with the most significant risks listed first. Make sure that you use lay language to describe a risk.] 

Occasional [If applicable, add: (Between a 1-10% chance that this will happen)]
* [List risks using a bulleted format with the most significant risks listed first. Make sure that you use lay language to describe a risk.]

Rare [If applicable, add: (Less than a 1% chance that this will happen)]
* [List risks using a bulleted format with the most significant risks listed first. Make sure that you use lay language to describe a risk.]

[Include the following paragraph if the study involves research biopsies, scans or x-rays.] Cancer research often includes biopsies, scans, x-rays that are also provided as routine care.  The following describes the side effects of procedures done only for the purposes of research. 

Risks Associated with Biopsies:
[For studies that involve biopsy of tissue other than bone marrow, use the following language. Include only what pertains to the research study.] Biopsies are normally performed under the guidance of an imaging technique. Each procedure requires a separate consent prior to the biopsy. The risks may include:
* Pain and discomfort. The amount of pain and discomfort will vary, depending on the location of the biopsy site. These risks can be discussed with the study doctor.
* Minor bleeding at the biopsy site.
* Tenderness at the biopsy site.
* Scarring at the biopsy site.
* Rarely, an infection at the biopsy site.

[If applicable insert the following:] Uncommonly, complications from biopsies can be life threatening. As with any interventional procedure, other potentially serious complications from bleeding or organ damage may occur. These might require additional surgical intervention.

Radiation Risks Associated with Scans and X-Rays: 
[This language will be reviewed by the appropriate Radiation Safety Offices and should be consistent with the Radiation Safety Screening Form.  Only include if the scans are not standard of care.]  While you are in this research study, CT scans, PET/CT scans, Bone Scans, x-rays, mammograms, and/or other scans utilizing radioactivity [Include only those scans/x-rays that are applicable.] may be used to evaluate your disease.  The frequency of these exams is slightly greater than what you would receive as standard care. In the long term, over many years, there is a very low risk of developing a new cancer as a result of the radiological evaluation and treatment for your cancer.  [Include if appropriate:] Certain types of drugs or combinations of these drugs with radiation may further slightly increase the risk of developing a new cancer.  This risk is described above, in the section about the risks associated with [study drug(s)].


Risks Associated with Mammograms: 
[For studies that involve ONLY mammograms that are more frequent than standard of care, you may use the following language. For studies that involve mammograms and other radioactive agents, please add this language to the previous section, "Risks Associated with Radiological Scans and X-Rays."]  While you are in this research study, mammograms may be used to evaluate your disease.  [If scans are for research purposes state: The frequency of these exams is greater than what you would receive as standard care.  But if scans are NOT for research purposes state: The frequency of these exams is about the same as what you would receive as standard care.] There is thought to be a low but increased risk of cancers associated with radiation in the long term over many years.  

[If done for screening purposes only, please include the following:] In addition, there is a chance of having an abnormal mammogram. This could require further testing with a breast biopsy and possible other tests. If you have an abnormal mammogram, this could result in your needing a breast biopsy you would not otherwise get. An abnormal mammogram may cause you to feel upset, worried, or depressed. If you are upset, you may speak with the research doctor or ask to be referred for additional emotional support.

Risks Associated with MRI Scans: 
When having an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan, you will lie still on a table that slides into a tunnel slightly wider than your body. People who feel uncomfortable in confined spaces (claustrophobia) may feel uncomfortable in the narrow cylinder. If you feel uncomfortable in confined spaces, please tell your research doctor.
