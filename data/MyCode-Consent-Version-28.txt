Geisinger Clinic invites you to take part in a project called the MyCode® Community Health Initiative 
(MyCode for short). By signing up for MyCode you agree to allow Geisinger to save your blood and saliva 
samples and use them for research.  You also agree to allow scientists doing research with your samples to use 
information in your health record.   
 
The goal of this research is to learn more about human health and disease to find better ways to keep people 
healthy and to help them when they are sick.   
 
Please read this whole document carefully before you decide whether or not to take part in this research. 
Please keep this document for your records. 
 
THIS FORM WILL TELL YOU: 
 Why we are doing this research 
 The benefits and risks of being a part of this research 
 How we will collect samples of your blood or saliva  
 How we will use your samples for research 
 How we will protect your privacy  
 
WHY DOES GEISINGER WANT TO KEEP MY BLOOD AND SALIVA SAMPLES? 
Information that is in your blood or saliva can provide clues about your health and diseases you have or might 
get.  Geisinger doctors and scientists want to do research to find these clues and learn how to use them to 
improve health.  
 
Some of these clues are found in your DNA (which is also known as deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA makes up 
your genes. Genes provide instructions for things like eye or hair color, height, and sometimes things that affect 
health.   Everyone’s DNA is slightly different.  By studying the DNA of many different people and comparing it 
to information in their health records we hope to find differences in DNA that help people stay healthy or in 
some cases get sick.  Your blood also contains proteins and other chemicals that can provide clues about your 
health and we may also study those.   
 
Many people are needed to provide samples to do this research.  We have samples from tens of thousands of 
Geisinger patients, and plan to collect more. Our goal is to enroll up to 500,000 Geisinger patients in this 
project.   
 
MyCode is a project of Geisinger Clinic.  MyCode activities (such as collecting, storing, or testing samples) 
may be paid for by the following sources:  
 Geisinger’s own funds; 
 Government grants; 
 Grants from non-profit agencies that support research; and/or 
 Commercial partners (such as drug companies)

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN I PARTICIPATE IN MYCODE? 
When you agree to participate in MyCode, you give us permission to: 
 Collect samples of your saliva or blood (not more than 2 tablespoons at a time) and store them in a 
biobank, which is a safe, secure place for storing the samples  
 Use your samples for research studies that we approve; This might include studies that analyze your 
DNA (your genes) 
 Use information from your Geisinger medical record for research studies that we approve; This 
information might include diseases you have, medicines you take, and results of medical tests you get 
 Contact you in the future to get more information or tell you about other research studies   
 Tell you about results we get from studying your samples that might help you  
 
HOW WILL YOU COLLECT MY MYCODE SAMPLES? 
There are several ways we might collect your samples;  
 A phlebotomist will collect a blood sample when you are having blood drawn because your doctor 
ordered tests 
 You can volunteer to provide MyCode blood samples when you aren’t already having blood drawn for 
test your doctor has ordered 
 You might be asked to provide a saliva (spit) sample using a kit we will provide 
  
WILL GEISINGER SHARE MY SAMPLES AND MY INFORMATION? 
Your samples and the information that we get from studying your samples or your medical record may be 
shared with other researchers. These researchers may work for: 
 Geisinger;  
 Universities or medical schools, or other research facilities; 
 Government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH); 
 Public agencies, foundations or other groups that conduct or sponsor research; or 
 Companies that do medical research, like drug companies   
 
Researchers must get permission to use your samples and information from two Geisinger  committees - the 
Geisinger Institutional Review Board and the MyCode Governing Board.  
 
The Geisinger Institutional Review Board is responsible for reviewing research that involves people. They 
decide if the research is done in a way that: 
 Limits the possible harm to the participants; 
 Makes sure that the risks of participating are reasonable; and 
 Protects your privacy 
 
The MyCode Governing Board makes sure that research that uses your samples and information will: 
 Be a good use of the samples and information in the MyCode biobank and 
 Help us learn more about health and disease 
 
HOW WILL YOU PROTECT MY PRIVACY? 
In most cases, researchers do not need information that could identify you when they are doing research using 
your MyCode samples and data.  Your samples and research data will be given a special code or study 
identification (ID) number. These ID numbers will be used to label samples and data when they are used for 
research, instead of information like your name or birth date that could be used to identify you.

IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258

Information that links you to your ID number will be kept in a secure file that is protected by Geisinger.  Only a 
few people on the MyCode team will have access to this file.  All of these people have been trained to protect 
your information.  Information that can identify you will be given to Geisinger researchers only when it is 
necessary for the research, and with the approval of the Geisinger Institutional Review Board and the MyCode 
Governing Board.  
  
If a non-Geisinger researcher wants information that identifies you, then a member of the MyCode team will 
contact you to see if you want to learn more about the study the researcher is doing.  If you agree to learn more 
about their study, then the MyCode team will give the researcher your contact information.  Then the researcher 
will contact you to tell you more about their study.  You have the right to decide whether or not: 
 You want to learn more about their study 
 You want to take part in their study 
 
All researchers who use MyCode samples or information are required to protect your privacy.   
 
We will not tell you every time your samples and/or information are used for research projects.  
 
WHO ELSE HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS MY PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION? 
Protected health information (PHI) is information about your health or your medical care that was collected 
by a healthcare provider (like Geisinger) that can be used to identify you.   
Federal and state laws are in place to protect your PHI.  Geisinger has departments that are responsible for 
making sure researchers follow these and other laws. Staff members in these departments may look at your 
research records to make sure we are following these laws.    
 
Your PHI may be shared if it is required by law. Regulatory organizations may inspect and/or copy your 
research records (including information in your medical record) for quality assurance. These organizations 
include the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These 
organizations must follow federal laws to protect your privacy when we are required to share your information. 
 
The chance that Geisinger will be required to share your PHI with these agencies is small. If your PHI is shared 
outside of Geisinger, then some federal privacy laws may not apply.  Some of these laws only apply to 
hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other healthcare providers.   
 
Geisinger will make every effort to protect your PHI, but we cannot absolutely guarantee that your information 
will be safe.  
 
Some genetic information that is uncovered by studying your DNA is unique to you (like fingerprints). When 
your genetic information is shared, we will make every effort to protect it. Researchers will promise not to try to 
identify you using any information they are given. The chance of anyone identifying you is small.  
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO BEING A PART OF THIS PROJECT? 
The main benefit of being a part of MyCode is helping researchers learn more about human health and disease.  
This will lead to better ways to treat disease and keep people healthy.   
 
There is a chance that researchers might find information that could be important to your health (and the health 
of your family members) when they study your MyCode samples. Based on what we know today, we will find 
information that will be useful for medical care in only about 2% (1 in 50) of MyCode participants. The chance 
of finding information important to your health will increase as we learn more about health and disease.

Geisinger has a team of experts who will decide what research results should be given to MyCode participants 
and how we should tell them. Examples of such research results are increased risk of developing serious 
diseases like heart disease or cancer or how a person might respond to a medicine.   
 
We will only inform you when we find information that we believe can be helpful in your medical care. At this 
time we will not tell you about health problems for which there are no medical treatments  (like Alzheimer’s 
disease or Huntington’s disease).  
 
Geisinger is committed to helping you understand and use the information that we might return to you as a 
result of your participation in MyCode.   
 
Research that uses your samples and information may not be finished quickly. There is a chance that you will 
not hear from any researchers. If you do not hear from anyone on the MyCode team: 
 Your sample may not have been studied yet OR 
 You may not have any of the gene changes that we are studying at this time  
 
WHAT HAPPENS IF A RESEARCHER FINDS INFORMATION THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT 
FOR MY HEALTH CARE? 
If we find information that we think you should know to help your medical care, then we will: 
 Tell you about the research result and what it means for your health; 
 Tell your healthcare provider;  
 Put this information in your medical record; and 
 Work with you to make sure that you understand what you should do about this information 
 
Information about your increased chances for a health problem may be important for your parents, your 
children, and/or your siblings. If you give us permission to contact your family, then the MyCode team will 
work with you to make sure that your family members also benefit from this information. If your family 
members are not Geisinger patients, then we will help them contact genetic professionals near where they live 
who can help them. You and your family members will: 
 Get information that tells you what we found in your sample 
 Get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem  
 Be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information  
 
The initial information and support Geisinger gives you will be free of charge.  Any appointments or testing that 
you choose to have done because of your increased chance will be billed to you and/or your health insurance 
provider.  
 
ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO BEING A PART OF THIS PROJECT? 
There are no risks involved in giving a saliva sample.  
 
If you give a blood sample for MyCode there is a small risk of bleeding, bruising, infection at the needle site, or 
fainting (this is rare).   
 
If we tell you that you have a higher chance of having a health problem because of something we discover from 
studying your sample, then there is a risk that you might be surprised or upset. 
 
There is a chance that your MyCode samples and information may be shared or used inappropriately. Geisinger 
takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and works hard to keep your information safe.  We cannot 
guarantee that your information will be kept private. We think the risk of your information being shared or used 
inappropriately is small. We also do not know every possible risk that might come up in the future.

CAN MY GENETIC INFORMATION BE USED AGAINST ME? 
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a federal law that makes it illegal for some 
companies to use genetic information against you. These companies include: 
 Health insurance companies 
 Group health plans 
 Most employers 
 
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act does not protect against discrimination by companies that sell 
life, disability, or long-term care insurance. At this time, the chances we would be required to share your genetic 
information with companies like this are small. 
 
DOES BEING IN THE STUDY COST ME ANYTHING? 
There is no extra cost to you or to your insurance company for being a part of MyCode.  
 
If you are one of the people who get information from MyCode about your health, then medical appointments 
or testing you choose to have done because of this information will be billed to you and/or your health 
insurance provider. For example, if we find that you have an increased chance of getting breast cancer, then 
your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often than most women. The cost of these mammograms 
may be covered by your health insurance policy or you may have to pay for them.  
 
WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS A PARTICIPANT? 
Being a part of this project is your choice. If you decide to participate now, but change your mind at any time 
later, then you can then withdraw from MyCode. Your decision will have no effect on the medical care you 
receive from Geisinger.  
 
If you wish to stop and no longer participate in MyCode, please write or call us using the contact information 
below. If you choose to call, we will send you a form to sign and return to us to complete the withdrawal 
process.

If you choose to stop being a part of MyCode we will not collect any new samples or information from you.  
Your samples in the MyCode biobank will be destroyed. If your information has been shared with researchers, 
then these researchers may keep using the information they have for research. 
 
You will not own any information, medical tests, medicines, or other products that are created from research 
that used samples and information from MyCode. You will not get any of these products for free or get any 
money or other payment from the sale of any such product(s).  
 
For questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact the Geisinger Institutional Review 
Board at 570-271-8663. When you call them, please give them the study number 2006-0258. 
 
HOW LONG WILL THIS STUDY LAST? 
There is no planned end date for MyCode.  Your samples and information will be kept until they are no longer 
useful for research, or the project ends.
