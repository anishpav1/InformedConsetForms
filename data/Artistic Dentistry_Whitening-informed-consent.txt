INFORMED CONSTENT FOR DENTAL WHITENING
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE
In-office tooth whitening is a procedure designed to lighten the color of my teeth
using a combination of a hydrogen peroxide gel and a specially designed ultraviolet
lamp MAY be used. The treatment involves using the gel and possibly a lamp in
conjunction with each other to produce maximum whitening results in the shortest
possible time. During the procedure, the whitening gel will be applied to my teeth
and my teeth may be exposed to the light lamp for one to three sessions. During
the entire treatment, a plastic retractor will be placed in my mouth to help keep it
open and the soft tissues of my mouth (i.e., my lips, gums, cheeks and tongue) will
be covered to ensure they are not exposed to either the gel or light. Vaseline may
also be applied as needed and I will be provided an ultraviolet light filter for my
eyes. After the treatment is completed, the retractor and all gel and tissue
coverings will be removed from my mouth.
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
I understand I may decide not to have the whitening treatment at all. However,
should I decide to undergo the treatment, I understand there are alternative
treatments for whitening my teeth for which my dentist can provide me additional
information. These treatments include: Whitening Toothpastes/Gels, other In-office
Whitening Treatments, Take-Home Whitening Kits
RISKS OF CONSENT FOR TREATMENT
I also understand that whitening treatment results may vary or regress due to a
variety of circumstances. I understand that almost all natural teeth can benefit from
whitening treatments and significant whitening can be achieved in most cases. I
understand that whitening treatments are NOT
intended to lighten artificial teeth, caps, crowns, veneers or porcelain, composite or
other restorative
materials and that people with darkly stained yellow or yellow-brown teeth
frequently achieve better
results than people with gray or bluish-gray teeth. I understand that teeth with
multiple colorations,
bands, splotches or spots due to tetracycline use or fluorosis do not whiten as well,
may need multiple
treatments or and may not whiten at all. I understand that teeth with many fillings,
cavities may not
lighten and are usually best treated with other non-bleaching alternatives. I
understand that
provisionals or temporaries made from acrylics may become discolored after
exposure to whitening treatment.

I understand that whitening treatment is not recommended for pregnant or lactating
women, light sensitive individuals, patients receiving PUVA (Psoralen + UVA
radiation) or other photochemotherapeutic drugs or treatment, as well as patients
with melanoma, diabetes or heart conditions. I understand that the Zoom! Lamp
emits ultraviolet radiation (UVA) and that patients taking any drugs that increase
photosensitivity should consult with their physician before undergoing Zoom!
treatment.
I understand that the results of my Zoom! Treatment cannot be guaranteed.
I understand that in-office whitening treatments are considered generally safe by
most dental
professionals.
I understand that some of the potential complications of this treatment include, but
are not limited to:
A. Tooth Sensitivity/Pain
During the first 24 hours after whitening treatment, some patients can
experience some tooth sensitivity or pain. This is normal and is usually mild,
but it can be worse in susceptible individuals. Normally, tooth sensitivity or
pain following a whitening treatment subsides
within 24 hours, but in rare cases can persist for longer periods of time in
susceptible individuals. People with existing sensitivity, recession, exposed
dentin, exposed root surfaces, recently cracked teeth, abfractions (microcracks), open cavities, leaking fillings, or other dental conditions that cause
sensitivity or allow penetration of the gel into the tooth may find that those
conditions increase or prolong tooth sensitivity or pain after whitening
treatment.
B. Gum/Lip/Cheek Inflammation
Whitening may cause inflammation of your gums, lips or cheek margins. This
is due to inadvertent exposure of a small area of those tissues to the
whitening gel or the ultraviolet light. The inflammation is usually temporary
which will subside in a few days but may persist longer and may result in
significant pain or discomfort, depending on the degree to which the
soft tissues were exposed to the gel or ultraviolet light.
C. Dry/Chapped Lips
The whitening treatment involves sessions during which the mouth is kept
open continuously for the entire treatment by a plastic retractor. This could
result in dryness or chapping of the lips or cheek margins, which can be
treated by application of petroleum jelly.
D. Cavities or Leaking Fillings
Most dental whitening is indicated for the outside of the teeth, except for
patients who have already undergone a root canal procedure. If any open
cavities or fillings that are leaking and allowing gel to penetrate the tooth are
present, significant pain could result. I understand that if my teeth have these
conditions, I should have my cavities filled or my fillings redone before
undergoing the whitening treatment.
E. Cervical Abrasion/Erosion

These are conditions which affect the roots of the teeth when the gums
recede and they are characterized by grooves, notches and/or depressions,
that appear darker than the rest of the teeth, where the teeth meet the
gums. These areas appear darker because they lack the enamel that covers
the rest of the teeth. Even if these areas are not currently sensitive, they can
allow
the whitening gel to penetrate the teeth, causing sensitivity. I understand
that if cervical
abrasion/erosion exists on my teeth, these areas will be covered with dental
dam prior to my whitening treatment.
F. Relapse
After the whitening treatment, it is natural for the teeth that underwent the
treatment to
regress somewhat in their shading after treatment. This is natural and should
be very gradual, but it can be accelerated by exposing the teeth to various
staining agents. Treatment usually involves wearing a take-home tray or
repeating the in-office whitening treatment. I understand that the results of
the whitening treatment are not intended to be permanent and secondary,
repeat or take-home treatments may be needed for me to maintain the tooth
shade I desire for my teeth.
Since it is impossible to state every complication that may occur as a result of
whitening treatment, the list of complications in this form is incomplete.
The basic procedures of whitening treatment and the advantages and
disadvantages, risks and known
possible complications of alternative treatments have been explained to me by Dr.
Peter Vanstrom or Dr. Anna Refai and/or their staff and all my questions have been
answered to my satisfaction.
In signing this informed consent I am stating I have read this informed consent (or it
has been read to
me) and I fully understand it and the possible risks, complications and benefits that
can result from the whitening treatment and that I agree to undergo the treatment.
