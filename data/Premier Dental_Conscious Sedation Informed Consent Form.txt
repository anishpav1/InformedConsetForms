consent to its use during your dental treatment. Please read each item carefully and initial next

1. I understand that the purpose of oral conscious sedation is to more comfortably receive
necessary dental treatment and that it has limitations and risks, and its absolute success
cannot be guaranteed.
2. I understand that oral conscious sedation is a drug induced state of reduced awareness
and may decrease my ability to respond. The sedative will not put me to sleep and I will
be capable of responding during the procedure. My ability to respond normally will
return when the effects of the sedative wear off.
3. I understand that the sedative prescribed will be a pill that I will take approximately
___________minutes before my scheduled appointment. The effects of this sedative
will last approximately____________hours.
4. I understand that the alternatives to oral conscious sedation are:
a. No sedation: Treatment is performed using a local anesthetic, or not, and the
patient is fully aware of surrounding activity.
b. Anxiolytics: A sedative pill is taken prior to treatment to reduce anxiety and fear.
c. Nitrous oxide sedation: Provides relaxation through inhalation of the gas, and
the patient is still generally aware of surrounding activity. Its effects are rapidly
reversed with the administration of oxygen. (Not offered by this office).
d. Intravenous sedation: The slow injection or drip of a sedative into to a vein.(Not
offered in this office)
e. General anesthetic: Generally used in a hospital setting, it requires breathing to
be supported and the patient has no awareness of his surroundings.

Additionally, with the use of oral sedation, the following risks are also present:
a. Inadequate sedation with the initial dosage which may require undergoing the
procedure without full sedation, or having to reschedule the procedure.

attention and/or hospitalization such as, but not limited to: altered mental state,
adverse physical reaction, allergic reaction or other unforeseen sicknesses.
c. The inability to discuss treatment options during the procedure should the
circumstance arise, that requires the Doctor to change the treatment plan.

indicated, I authorize her to proceed with it. I also understand that I have the right to
