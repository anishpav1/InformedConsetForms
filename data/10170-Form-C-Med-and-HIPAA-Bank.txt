									
Instructions: Because there is extensive variation in the design and operation of research repositories, a "one size fits all" template is not feasible. Investigators banking biological material for an individual study or research repository are directed to the document:  "Issues to be Addressed and Sample Consent Language for Tissue/Specimen Repositories or Individual Studies Banking Material for Future Use" [PDF].  The document presents optional approaches for the consent process, issues for consideration (that may or may not apply), and sample template language.   
The following is a pre-fabricated template including sample language from the issues document.  While this version is more user-friendly from a technical perspective, investigators are encouraged to first refer to the issues document above to customize a form and process that fits the unique characteristics of the repository or banking study. 
 
Instructions, examples and optional wording are italicized.   Reformat and remove the instructions, unwanted text, and underlines from the final form. Use lay language and terminology throughout the document and consider use of educational tools such as glossaries, illustrations, etc to simplify the consent form and enhance the consent process.
Sample Consent to Participate in a Research Repository or 
Individual Study Banking Material for Future Use

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BANK?

The purpose of the bank is to collect and store samples of (tissue, blood, and/or other biologic specimens), along with health information for research purposes.  Researchers can then use the stored materials for future research studies to learn more about (cancer, diabetes, and other health problems).  The bank provides a ready supply of samples, so researchers do not have to look for donors for each new study.  

The bank will enroll _______(number) of participants. 
OR
The goal of the bank is to ask patients ______ (specify pool of potential participants) if they would like to participate. Having samples from many people allows the researchers to identify trends and discover better ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat many conditions. 
The researchers who obtain your samples from the bank may use the genetic material (genes, DNA, RNA) in your sample to learn about the role genes play in heath and disease.  Results of genetic studies may also reveal information about your family members.  

WHERE WILL SAMPLES AND INFORMATION BE STORED AND FOR HOW LONG?

The samples and information will be stored at ______________ (describe location/facility) ________________ (indefinitely, for no longer than XXX years/months) or until they are all used up. 

WHAT WILL THE BANK COLLECT AND STORE FOR RESEARCH? 

If collecting leftover tissue: 
We would like to keep some of the tissue or sample that is leftover from a procedure that you are already having as part of your clinical care, such as a blood draw, surgery, or biopsy.  Your tissue or sample will always be used first to help make clinical decisions about your care or health.  

If collecting extra tissue from a clinical procedure: 
We would like to collect ____ (specify amount) of extra tissue from your (specify procedure, surgery, biopsy) that you are already having as part of your clinical care.  Your tissue or sample will always be used first to help make clinical decisions about your care or health.  The extra tissue will be kept for research.  

If collecting blood or other specimens:
We would like to collect (draw x tube(s), about X tablespoons) of blood; a sample of urine, saliva, hair, etc.) for use in future research. 

Specify if collecting information from participant such as a health questionnaire or medical history:
We also would like (to interview you and/or for you to answer some questions on a form about your health, medical condition, medical history, and/or quality of life. You can skip any question that you do not want to answer. (If bank protocol involves repeated contacts to update information) We will contact you no more than once a year to update this information.

Specify if requesting current and future access to the medical record:
We also would like to have permission to look at your medical records from time to time. We would collect general information related to your health such as test results, treatments, and doctor's notes. Medical records may also include psychiatric, genetic, HIVAIDS, alcohol/substance abuse information. The confidentiality section below provides details about how we will keep your information private.

WILL YOU BE CONTACTED ABOUT FUTURE RESEARCH?

Neither the bank nor researchers who access samples or information from the bank will contact you about future research.  If you wish to participate in research studies, you may find information at http://www.ccts.uky.edu/ccts/participate-research.

HOW WILL THE BANK SHARE SAMPLES AND INFORMATION WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS? 

Your sample or information may be shared with University of Kentucky (UK) researchers and researchers outside of UK.  Researchers may contact the bank to request permission to use samples or information for their studies.  An oversight committee will review the researcher's qualifications and proposed research. The committee will also determine if any additional review or approval is necessary. 

If plan includes sharing only de-identified sample/information:  
The bank will remove all information that could identify you such as your name, address, medical record number, etc, before sharing with researchers. Include if applicable: The bank will use ________________ (a process, software, barcodes) to match your samples with your medical information without releasing your identity. The researchers will sign an agreement promising not to try to use any of the sample or information to identify you. The bank will not share information that could identify you without your permission.  
 
Large-Scale Data Sharing:
Researchers can do studies that are more powerful when they share with each other the data or information they get from studying human samples.  Information from analyses of your samples and your medical information may be put into scientific databases available on the Internet, along with information from other research participants.  Your name and other information that could identify you will not be included.  Therefore, no one would know just from looking at the data that the information came from you.  

Genome Wide Association Studies:
Include if recipient investigators will be submitting data generated from NIH-supported and NIH-conducted research to GWAS:
If "open access": Anonymous information from the analyses may be put in a completely public database, available to anyone on the Internet.
If "restricted access":  Your coded medical information and information from more detailed analyses of your coded samples may be put in a controlled-access database. The information in this database will be available only to researchers who have received approval from Data Access Committee at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Identifying information such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, will not be put into the scientific databases.

WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THE (BANK)? 

There is no direct benefit to you.  The knowledge gained from research on your sample may help others in the future. 

ARE THERE RISKS FROM TAKING PART IN THE (BANK)?

Physical: 
There is no additional physical risk from collecting leftover tissue from a procedure that is being done as part of your clinical care.  

Include if additional blood is being collected as part of the research via venipuncture: 
Risks associated with blood sampling are generally slight, but may include soreness, bruising, pain, infection, possible fainting, bleeding. 

Include if additional tissue will be collected during a clinical procedure: 
When we collect extra tissue during your procedure, we will limit the amount so that there is no significant increase in risk to you OR describe specific additional risks associated with additional tissue collection.  

Privacy and Social/Psychological: 
There is a risk that someone could get access to the information stored in the bank.  In spite of the security measures and safeguards we will use, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known.  

Include if genetic testing is possible: 
Even without your name or identifiers, genetic information is unique to you making it possible for someone to trace it back to you. The results of genetic research apply to both you and your family members.  In some cases, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance.  Genetic information could be used in ways that could cause you or your family distress.  

There is a Federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).  Generally, GINA makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Be aware that GINA does not protect you against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  It also does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of already known genetic disease.

Unknown:
There may be risks that at this time are unknown.  As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking information back to you that we cannot foresee now.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET HURT OR SICK DURING THE STUDY?
