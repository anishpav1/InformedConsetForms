INFORMAT ION INFORMED CONSENT

APICOECTOMIES AND APICAL SURGERY
I UNDERSTAND that APICOECTOMIES include possible inherent risks such as, but not limited to the following:
1.

Injury to the nerves: This would include injuries causing numbness of the lips; the tongue; any tissues of the mouth;
and/or cheeks or face. Th is numbn ess could occur and may be of a temporary na ture, la sting a few days, a few weeks; a few
months; or could possibly be permanent, and could be the result of surgical procedures or anesthetic administration.

2.

Bleeding, bruising, swelling: Bleeding may last several hours. If bleeding is profuse, you must contact us as soon as
possible. Some swellin g is norm al, but if severe, you should notify us. Brui ses or hemat omas may persist for some time.

3.

Infection: No matter how carefully surgical sterility is maintained, it is possible, due to existing non-sterile or infected oral
environment, infections may occur postoperatively. At times, infections may be of a serious nature. Should severe swelling
occur, particularly accompanied with fever or malaise, attention as soon possible should be received.

4.

Sinus or Mandibular Canal Involvement: In some cases, the roots of the teeth that are going to be apically treated lie in
closer apposition to the Maxillary Sinuses or to the Mandibular Canal, including the Mental Foramen than they appear to
be radiographically. Even though a rare occurrence, there is a slight possibility that the Maxillary Sinus or the Mandibular
Canal may be perforated, or the nerves emanating from the Mental Foramen may be traumatized during the surgical
procedure involved with removing the apices of the infected teeth.

5.

Injury to adjacent teeth or adjacent roots: There is a possibility of injury to an adjacent tooth or to roots of teeth during
the procedure. If an adjacent tooth or roots of teeth are inadvertently nicked or otherwise damaged during the surgical
procedures, conventional endodontic treatment, endodontic surgery, or extraction may be required.

6.

Bacteria l Endocarditis: Because of n ormal existence of bacteria in the or al cavi ty, the tissues of the h eart, as a resul t of
reasons known or unknown, may be susceptible to bacterial infection transmitted through blood vessels, and Bacterial
Endocarditi s (an infection of the hear t) could occur. Pre-existing condi tions causing valvular dysfunction are the most
likely cause of this complication. It is my responsibility to inform the dentist of any heart problems known or suspected.

7.

Failure: Even though the surgical pr ocedure is properly perform ed, th ere exi sts th e possibility th at th e attempt to preser ve
the tooth will fail due to the tooth and tissues not responding as they should, thereby necessitating extraction of the tooth.

8.

Unusual reactions to medications given or prescribed: Reactions, either mild or severe, may possi bly occur fr om
anesthetics or other medications administered or prescribed. All prescription drugs must be taken according to instructions.
Women using oral cont raceptives must be aware that a ntibiotics that m ay be necessary to control in fection can render t hese
contraceptives ineffective. Other methods of contraception must be utilized during the treatmen t period.

9.

It is my responsibility to seek attention should any undue circumstances occur postoperatively and I shall diligently
follow any preoperative and postoperative instructions given me.

INFORMED CONSENT: I have been given the opportunity to ask any questions regarding the nature and purpose of surgical
treatmen t known as Apicoectomy an d have received answers to my satisfaction. I h ave been given the option of seekin g care from
any oral-maxillofacial surgeon; a periodontist; and/or endodontist. I do voluntarily assume any and all possible risks, including the
risk of substantial h arm, if an y, which may be associated with any phase of this treatm ent in hopes of obtaining the desired results,
which may or may not be achieved. No guarantees or promises have been made t o me concerning my recover y and r esults of
treatment to be rendered to me. The fee(s) for this service have been explained to me and are satisfactory. By signing this form, I
am freely giving my consent to allow and authorized Dr. ______________________ and his/her associates to render any treatment
necessary or advisable to my dental conditions, in cluding an y and all anesth etics and/or medicat ions.
