Instructions:
● Complete the assent form based on the research protocol.
● Some items in this template are optional or based on certain types of studies. Review the guidance throughout the template.
● Refer to HRP-013 Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians, HRP-090 Informed Consent Process for Research, HRP-091 Written Documentation of Consent in the HRPP Toolkit Library.
● For additional resources on drafting a consent form, consider the following:
○ Medical terms, procedures, and conditions for younger children and teenagers
○ Plain Language Thesaurus for Health Communications
○ Clear Language and Design
○ MN Health Literacy
○ Readability calculator (use Flesch-Kincaid score)
● Remove help text and instructions before submitting the assent form draft to the IRB. 
● The readability of the assent has to be age appropriate which means it could be at a 1st or 3rd or 6th grade reading level or anything in between depending on the age or circumstances of the minor. For example, detained adolescent youths typically have a reading level of 3rd grade. Do not assume that literacy and age are correlated.
● Young people are often confused by the "we" in the consent template. Unless there are a number of people involved in obtaining assent, use the pronoun 'I,' not 'we.'
