[If appropriate to the study, include the following risk statement(s)- remove or revise as applicable]

Breach of Privacy and Confidentiality: As with any study involving collection of data, there is the possibility of breach of confidentiality of data. Every precaution will be taken to secure participants' personal information to ensure confidentiality. 

Washout period: During this study the medication you normally use for your condition will/may be stopped for up to [XX days/weeks/months]. You will/may receive no medication, or medication at a dose which may not help your condition. As a result, you will/may have an increase in symptoms including XX.

Placebo:  During this study there is a XX chance that you will receive a placebo. This could lengthen the amount of time before you receive a treatment that may be effective. During this time you may experience worsening of your condition, including increased symptoms such as XX. The researchers will carefully monitor your condition. If your symptoms worsen and make you uncomfortable, you can withdraw from the study.

Blood draw:  Removing blood by a needle may cause temporary pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling, dizziness, and on rare instances fainting or infection. 

Exercise testing: The exercise test may cause muscle soreness, dizziness, or shortness of breath. In rare instances, exercise tests may cause chest pain, tightness, or a change in vital signs. 

Psychological discomforts: Some of the procedures may cause embarrassment or anxiety, or the questions the researchers ask you may be upsetting or make you uncomfortable.  If you do not wish to answer a question, you can skip it and go to the next question.  If you do not wish to participate you can stop.

HIV testing:  Being tested for HIV may make you feel nervous or anxious about the test results.  A positive test indicates that you have been infected with the HIV virus, but no one knows for certain when, if ever, you will become sick with AIDS or a related condition.  Receiving positive results may make you very upset.  If other people learn about your positive test results, you may have trouble obtaining insurance or employment. To the extent permitted by law, the researchers will keep your test results confidential and will not release them to anyone without your written permission. If you test positive, California law requires health care providers and clinical laboratories to report the HIV test results with your personal identifying information to the local health department.

Unknown risks: [Required if this research is a medical intervention, or a clinical investigation with investigational drug, biological product or device; or risk profile of research intervention is not well known]
There may be risks related to the research that we don't know about yet.  However, you will be informed of any additional risks to which you may be exposed, and any changes that are made to the study, as a result of any newly-identified risks. 

Reproductive Risks: [Required if the study intervention could harm unborn baby.  All of the following statements in this section may be modified as applicable.]
You should not get pregnant while in this study. The [specify: experimental procedure, investigational treatment, experimental drug] used in this study could harm an unborn baby. Check with the researchers about what types of birth control, or pregnancy prevention, to use while in this study.

You should also not breastfeed a baby while in this study, as the [specify: experimental procedure, investigational treatment, experimental drug] used in this study could harm a newborn baby.

If you are a male, you should not father a baby while on this study.  

If you or your partner does become pregnant during the study, you should contact the researchers immediately.  

Pregnancy Testing in Minors 
[Required if the form is to obtain parental permission and the study includes pregnancy testing in minors.]
If your child is a female and has had her menses (her period) she will have some of her [specify: blood and / or urine] collected at different times in the study for the purposes of pregnancy testing.  Per California Law, pregnancy test results will be provided to you only with permission from your child.

Research records provided to authorized, non-Chapman entities will not contain identifiable information about you.  Publications and/or presentations resulting from this study will not include identifiable information about you.  

While the research team will make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, it is possible that an unauthorized person might see it.  We cannot guarantee total privacy

Certificate of Confidentiality [If not applicable, please remove]
To help us protect your privacy, [we have obtained / are in the process of obtaining] a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.

The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet federal requirements.

A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.

The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, without your consent, information that would identify you as a participant in the research project under the following circumstances. [State here the conditions under which voluntary disclosure would be made (e.g., Examples: child abuse, elder abuse, domestic violence or sexual assault). If no voluntary disclosures will be made, the researchers should so state.]

Whenever a Chapman University employee, in his/her professional capacity or within the scope of his/her employment, has knowledge of or observes a person under the age of 18 years whom the employee knows, or reasonably suspects, to have been the victim of child abuse or neglect, the employee must report the incident to the appropriate authorities.


ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY? 
[If the considerations listed below are not applicable, please remove this heading]

[Required if the study involves collection of specimens]
Use of Specimens 
[If specimens will be discarded] 
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for routine labs will be discarded or destroyed once they have been used for the purposes described in this consent.

 [If specimens will be retained by Chapman University]
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for this study will become the property of the Chapman University.  Once you provide the specimens you may not have access to them.  Use of the specimens could result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial products or other products that may be developed from the use of your specimens.

[If specimens will be provided to an outside entity, such as the study sponsor]
Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for the purposes of this study will be provided to the Sponsor of this study [, sponsor name optional]. Once you provide the specimens you may not have access to them. Use of the specimens could result in discoveries that could become the basis for new products or therapeutic agents. In some instances, these discoveries may be of potential commercial value. You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from such a product. 

Genetics [Required if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information]
[Standard Template] In the event of an unexpected breach of confidentiality, a federal law called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) will help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information obtained about you. In California, state law (CalGINA) requires that employers with 5 or more employees may not use your genetic information, obtained from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. However, these laws do not protect you against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. 

If you would like more information about the federal GINA law go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf or CalGINA: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0551-0600/sb_559_bill_20110906_chaptered.pdf

[Alternative language for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] In the event of an unexpected breach of confidentiality, a federal law called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) will help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information obtained about you. In California, state law (CalGINA) requires that employers with 5 or more employees may not use your genetic information, obtained from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. 
  
GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  
  
If you would like more information about the federal GINA law go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf or CalGINA: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0551-0600/sb_559_bill_20110906_chaptered.pdf


Request for Donation of Specimens and/or Data for Future Use [Required when subjects are asked to donate leftover biospecimens or collecting additional biospecimens. Specify how the donated biospecimens will be used. It is STRONGLY recommended that a tiered consent process be used if the researcher is able to track the levels of consent for each participant.  Refer to NCI Best Practices Bio specimen Resources manual for more information: http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/global/pdfs/NCI_Best_Practices_060507.pdf] Examples - Keep all statements that apply to this study and remove/revise as applicable.
