Meaning of informed consent

INFORMED CONSENT
Informed consent indicates permission voluntarily expressed by the patient to medical and/or
nursing, obstetric, or technical personnel for the execution of procedures and/or treatments
deemed necessary during the stay in hospital.
1. PURPOSE

To ensure that in clinical practice, the individual is truly and exhaustively informed
of the diagnosis, the prognosis, and the treatment proposed and its possible consequences,
so that s/he may make manifest his/her consent for the treatments.
2. GENERAL CONSENT

I/We, the undersigned ______________________________________________________
(or parent/s) of ___________________________________________________________
born in __________________________________________ on ____________________
declare that I/we have been informed by the medical/nursing/obstetric/technical personnel
that during the period of hospitalisation, services related to diagnostic/therapeutic/rehabilitative
treatment and corresponding nursing/obstetric care may be required.
These services regard:
venous/arterial/capillary blood samples
pharmacological therapy administered according to medical prescription
recording of vital clinical data, such as, for example, blood pressure, temperature, heart
rate, respiratory frequency, etc.
medical examination
nursing/obstetric/rehabilitative care following the treatment plan.
SPECIAL CASES
1. In the event that the subject who must give consent is a minor or is unable to understand
and express his/her will, valid consent is given by the person exercising parental authority
or guardianship. In particular:
if one of the parents is unable to exercise authority due to incapacity or other impediment
(duly documented and supported), authority is exercised exclusively by the other parent
if the parents are separated or divorced, exercise of authority rests with the parent to whom
the child is entrusted
