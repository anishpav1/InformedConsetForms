FOR PATIENTS WITH DNR ORDERS

I have been advised and understand that undergoing surgical procedures and the accompanying anesthesia subjects me to new and

9 Maintain and honor DNR Order during surgery.
9 Suspend DNR Order during surgery until transferred from post-anesthesia care.

BLOOD TRANSFUSION

Blood or blood components may be necessary before, during, or after the procedure. I have been fully informed that no transfusion is 100%
safe, however with present testing methods, the risk is very small. Risks include infection from viruses, bacteria, or parasites, including
but not limited to HIV (the AIDS virus) or hepatitis, as well as fever, chills, allergy, fluid overload or death. I have discussed possible
alternatives with my healthcare provider, including no transfusion, autologous transfusion (donation of my own blood), designated/directed
donor transfusion (collection of blood from donors selected by me), or blood salvaged during the procedure. I understand that all these
alternatives may not be available due to timing or health reasons, and that the above risks may still apply. 9 N/A 9 Consent 9 Decline

SEDATION CONSENT FOR NON-OR PROCEDURES ONLY
I understand that in rare instances sedation may fail or become less effective and result in an emergency situation during the course of
the procedure. If an emergent situation were to arise, the anesthesia team from Kaleida Health may become involved in my care to safely
resolve the emergency situation and to manage my pain. I therefore consent to an alternative type of anesthesia, and additional anesthetic
procedures if necessary, as deemed appropriate. If not an emergency but when an appropriate level of sedation cannot be reached safely,
I also understand that my procedure may need to be rescheduled to involve the anesthesia care team.
