About total number of subjects will take part in this research study at Boston University.

Name of funding agency/sponsor is paying for this research to be done.


How long will I take part in this research study?

We expect that you will be in this research study for total study time.  During this time, we will ask you to make number study visits to location (e.g. Psychology lab at Boston University)


What will happen if I take part in this research study?

INSTRUCTIONS: Provide a list of all study procedures/tests/activities and when they will occur.  Include the following information:

* The length and duration of visits and procedures. 
* Which procedures are being performed as standard of care and which are part of the research study, when applicable.

* Special requirements, e.g., stopping current medications, fasting before tests
* Reasons and procedures for early withdrawal from the study
* Sending data/specimens to research collaborators 
* Storage of data/specimens for future use 
If you agree to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign the consent form before we do any study procedures.

Study Visit 1

INSTRUCTIONS:  Below is a list of possible procedures. Customize this list for your study.  Use the format below for all subsequent study visits (Visit 2, Visit 3, etc.) 
Visit 1 will take about how long to complete.  At this visit, we will ask you to do the following procedures:
* Give you some questionnaires to fill out about your physical health, mood, mental and emotional health, quality of life, and habits
* Ask about your medical and mental history
* Ask about your medications
* Measure your vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart and breathing rates)
* Give you and ECG (electrocardiogram).  This test checks the electrical activity of your heart.  We will place several, small, sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs.  There is a wire attached to each pad.  The wires connect to a machine that makes a recording of your heart rhythm.
* Interview you about your experiences with describe subject.
* Take part in a focus group.  A focus group is a small group of people who take part in a discussion about a selected topic.  The focus group will be led by a member of the research staff.  The focus group leader will ask the group members about their opinion of topic.
* Give you an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your body location.  A MRI is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body.  During the MRI, we will ask you to lie still on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine.  The machine is slightly wider than your body.  The top and sides of the tunnel will be very close to your body.  The MRI machine makes loud noises as it take pictures of the insides of your body.  We will give you earplugs to reduce the noise.  You will be able to hear and speak to the research staff at all times during the MRI procedures.  We can stop the procedure at any time, if necessary, the MRI will take about amount of time.

Before you have the MRI, we will ask you about any metal within your body (this includes certain dyes in tattoos).  You will need to remove all metal objects (such as hearing aids, dentures, jewelry, watches, and hairpins) from your body because these objects may be attracted to the powerful magnet used for the test.  
* Ask you complete tasks on the computer
* Give you an EEG (electroencephalogram).  An EEG is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of your brain. We will put special sensors (electrodes) on your head.  There is a wire attached to each sensor.  The wires connnect to a computer. The computer records your brain's electrical activity on the screen or on paper as wavy lines.


INSTRUCTIONS:  If subjects will be randomized to different study arms include the information below.
We will assign you by chance (like a coin toss) to one of two study groups.  One group will describe group (e.g will receive brochures on lifestyle changes) and the other group describe group (e.g. will receive brochures on lifestyle changes and also meet with a counselor).  You and the researcher cannot choose your study group.  You will have an equal chance/ 2 out of 2 chance, etc. of being assigned to either study group.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If subjects will be audio or video taped, add the following information.  Choose the appropriate language depending on whether audio or video taping will be done.  Include information about how the tapes will be used and how long they will be stored.

Audio/Videotaping

What are the risks of taking part in this research study?
INSTRUCTIONS: The information in this section should be limited to the risks and discomforts related to the procedures done for research purposes, and should not include those related to a research subject's routine medical care.  Below are some common risks. Customize this section according to your protocol.
MRI Risks
There are no known harmful effects from the strong magnetic field used for MRI. But the magnet is very powerful. The magnet may affect pacemakers, artificial limbs, and other medical devices that contain iron. The magnet will stop a watch that is close to the magnet. Any loose metal object has the risk of causing damage or injury if it gets pulled toward the strong magnet.
You should not have an MRI if you have claustrophobia (fear of small spaces).  The top and sides of the machine will be very close to your body.  Because of this, you may feel anxious while inside the MRI machine.  If you do feel anxious during the procedure, you can ask us to stop the MRI at any time.
If you are pregnant or suspect you are pregnant, you should inform the study staff before the MRI examination. Although there is no known risk of using MRI in pregnant women, the safety of MRI during pregnancy has not been established.  Therefore, you cannot have an MRI for this study if you are pregnant or think that you are pregnant.
We are doing the MRI in this study to answer research questions, not to give you medical care.  This MRI is not the same as one that your own doctor would order.  It may or may not show problems that would be found on a regular MRI,
If we do see something that looks like a medical problem, we will ask a radiologist (a doctor who specializes in looking at MRI scans results) to review the results.  If the radiologist thinks there might be a problem, we will tell you and help you get follow-up care.
            If the radiologist thinks that you might have a medical problem, but it turns out that you don't, we may have caused you to worry unnecessarily.

	Risks of Completing Tasks
	
	You may get tired during the tasks.  You can rest at any time.

	Questionnaire/Survey Risks
	
You may feel emotional or upset when answering some of the questions.  Tell the interviewer at any time if you want to take a break or stop the interview.

You may be uncomfortable with some of the questions and topics we will ask about.  You do not have to answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable.

Loss of Confidentiality

The main risk of allowing us to use and store your information for research is a potential loss of privacy.  We will protect your privacy by labeling your information with a code and keeping the key to the code in a password-protected computer.

Focus Groups
The researchers will ask you and the other people in the group to use only first names during the group session. They will also ask you not to tell anyone outside the group what any particular person said in the group. However, the researchers cannot guarantee that everyone will keep the discussions private.
