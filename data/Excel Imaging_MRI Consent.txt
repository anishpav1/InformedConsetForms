INFORMATION CONCERNING GADOLINIUM CONTRAST MATERIAL
As part of your examination, the MRI radiologist may deem it advisable to give you an intravenous injection of
a contrast agent containing Gadolinium. This injection may help the physician more accurately diagnose your
condition. Although Gadolinium contrast agents have been used safely in millions of cases, minor reactions
(principally headache or nausea) occur in about 2% of patients, whereas serious or life threatening reactions
have been reported in about one in 400,000 patients.
7. Have you ever had a previous allergic reaction to Gadolinium contrast material?
8. Do you have a history of asthma or emphysema?
9. Do you have any drug allergies?
10. Do you have anemia or any other blood diseases?
11. Do you have any kidney problems?
12. If female, are you breast feeding?
