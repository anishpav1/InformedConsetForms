Using Children as Research Participants:  the Assent Process and Document 



"Assent" typically refers to a child's agreement to participate in research; that is, to say "OK."  Assent may be obtained by talking with the child and supporting that discussion with a written assent document appropriate to the child's age and comprehension level or by noting the assent in the research records.  In determining if children are capable of giving meaningful assent, the IRB will take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children, either individually or as a group, as it deems appropriate. 

Children's ages and maturational levels are only gross indices of mental level and reasoning capacity.  For example, young children can best understand very concrete explanations; after 12 or 13 years of age, most can adequately deal with abstract ideas. Pictures are often used to clarify concepts to children - and adults.  A child's level of comprehension and reasoning will be altered by anxiety and physical or emotional disturbances. 

Every assent process and document should include the following:
1. an explanation of the purpose of the protocol; 
2. what is required of the child; 
3. what the child will experience while participating in the protocol (e.g., not going home, separation from parents, presence of other patients); 
4. an explanation of risks, discomforts, or inconveniences; and 
5. a description of benefits to the child or to others. 

The PI, in consultation with the UMCIRB, will decide if the protocol requires an assent document for the child in addition to a permission form for the parents or guardian.  The decision will be based primarily on the expected level of comprehension of the proposed research participants.
 
The parents or guardian of a child participant must be fully informed and given a parental permission document to read and sign before their child can participate in the research.  If the child is between the ages of 7 years and 12 years or cannot read, oral assent must be obtained from the child.  This assent can then be documented in the research records.  The parent's or guardian's signature indicating parental permission is in addition to the one confirming oral assent.  The following should be placed on the signature page of the consent form that the parent(s) sign to assist in the documentation of these occurrences:

"By initialing in the following places, the parent/guardian and investigator indicate their opinion that the patient is too young or otherwise not able to give consent/assent."

_______Parent/Guardian				_________Investigator


Any research involving children requires their assent in one form or another, except when the IRB determines that (a) the capability of the child to be involved in the assent process is limited because of age, state of consciousness, or other factors, or (b) the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit for the child that is not available with any of the current alternatives.  In the latter case, the regulations recognize that parents and physicians control treatment choices and may properly override a child's refusal to take part in the research. 

Investigators must consider the number of parental signatures required according to DHHS regulations at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D and FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.50 Subpart D, as follows:
* Research involving no greater than minimal risk requires one parent's signature.
* Research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to the child requires one parent's signature.
* Research involving greater than minimal risk where there is no prospect of direct benefit to the child, but is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the child's disorder or condition requires both parents' signatures, unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.
* Research not otherwise approvable but which presents an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children requires both parents' signatures, unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.

The IRB may require that the child's assent be obtained verbally or may required documentation of assent.  The child should be given the same consideration and respect when obtaining informed assent as is given to any other individual being asked to take part in research.  

At ECU, unless otherwise determined by the IRB, documented assent is required for children 12 to 17 years of age.  Children 7 to 11 years of age should be given the opportunity to give verbal assent, with the script to be used in these situations submitted for IRB review and approval.  As noted above, verbal assent should be documented in the research record or on the parental permission form.  For children under the age of 7 years, the research should be explained to the extent of the child's understanding but no documentation is required (either as an assent document, a statement of attestation on the parental permission form, or in the research record).  Parental permission becomes even more critical in these situations.
