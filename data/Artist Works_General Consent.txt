Cancellation and Broken Appointment Policy
We understand that illness, emergencies, flat tires, and bad weather do occur. We ask our
patients to call us 2 business days before your scheduled appointment to reschedule if you're not
able to honor your appointment. This allows us time to fill our schedule with other patients that
may desire the time that was given to you.
Policy and Fees:
Rescheduling of an appointment with 2 business days notification – no charge
Failure to give a 2 business days in advance notice:



$35 for all preventative appointments
$50 for all treatment appointments

Definition of “Broken Appointment”: A broken appointment is when you



Reschedule an appointment with less than 2 business day notice
Do not show up for the scheduled appointment

Our number one concern is our patient’s dental health. Providing services in a timely manner is
critical to accomplish that goal. Our other goal is to keep the cost of dental services as
economical as possible. Our office will reserve an appointment time that is dedicated to you and
your treatment only . At Artistic Works Dentistry we avoid "double booking" our patients to
minimize the wait time in the office. We firmly believe that your time is as important to you as
our time is to us. As a result of our scheduling policies we strive to do all that we can to be
punctual for your appointment, which we have reserved together. In return, we ask that you
extend the same courtesy to us. When you fail to keep your appointment without providing us
adequate notice, this adds to the overall cost of care, as trained professionals and dental facilities
are not being utilized.
We appreciate your understanding and consideration regarding our appointment policy and if
you have any questions or concerns, never hesitate to ask us at Artistic Works Dentistry.

I have read and understand the above mentioned policy.
