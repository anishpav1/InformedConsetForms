SAMPLE ASSENT FORM #3
NOTE: See Minors in Research guidelines, Adolescent Assent-Option B. This format can be used for studies with a very complex protocol and/or involving adolescent subjects whose medical condition demands a simpler form than the adult's form, even when the adult's form is written at an eighth-grade level.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF)

ASSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH SUBJECT
of a New Drug, THX333, to Treat
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

For adolescents 13-17 years old

What is this study about?
Keith Chavez, Ph.D., Linda Wong, Ph.D., and Glen McSweeney, M.D., Ph.D., from the UCSF Department of Psychiatry, are doing a research study.  The study will test if THX333 is safe for children and adolescents.  THX333 is a new medicine for ADHD.  It is made by the Smith Pharmaceutical Company.

The study doctors hope this drug will help young people with ADHD get better, but they don't know if it will for sure.  That's why they're doing the study.

Because you have ADHD, the doctors are asking if you want to be in this study. 

How many people will take part in this study?
About 300 children and adolescents (6 to 17 years old), across the United States, will be in this study.  About 30 of them will participate at UCSF.

What will happen if you decide you might want to be in this research study?
First, your parents will be asked if they give their permission for you to be in this study. They will also be asked if they agree to participate themselves, by doing some things like answering questions about you. If your parents don't agree, you cannot be in the study. 
If your parents do agree, and you agree too, here's what will happen next:

   Before you begin the study:
1. The study doctor will ask your parents some questions about you.

2. The study doctor will ask you questions about your health. 

3. You will have a physical exam, and you will give some urine and some blood for the doctors to test. 

4. Some of the urine collected from you will be tested for illegal drugs, in order to see if you can be included in the study.  If any illegal drugs are found in your urine, you and your parents will be told, and you won't be able to be in the study.

5. You will also get an ECG.  During an ECG, sticky patches are placed on your chest, arms, and legs.  These patches connect to wires that go to a machine that measures the electrical activity of your heart.

ONLY GIRLS NEED TO READ THE NEXT SECTION, #6:

6. If the study medicine is taken by a girl who is pregnant (having a baby), it could harm the baby.  Therefore we want to make sure that nobody who is pregnant is taking this medicine.  

It is possible for a girl who has had her first menstrual period and has started sexual activity to become pregnant.  So if you have had your first menstrual period, whether you have had sexual activity or not, a urine test will be done at the first visit. Also your blood will be tested twice, at the first and last visit, to make sure you are not pregnant.

If you start being sexually active during the study, you must use a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, for example, a condom along with a sperm-killing jelly, or a pill that prevents pregnancy.  If you are having sex but are not sure if the type of sex you are having can cause you to get pregnant, or if you are not sure if you are using a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, please ask the study doctor to explain. As you probably know, the most reliable way to avoid getting pregnant is to not have sex.

If you think you might be pregnant, you must stop using the study medicine immediately and notify the study doctor or the study staff.  You and your parents will be told if you have a positive pregnancy test (in other words, if the urine or blood test shows that you are pregnant).

ALL (GIRLS AND BOYS) CONTINUE TO READ HERE:

   During the study:
7. If you are going to stay in the research study after the questions and tests described above, you will have to stop any medication for ADHD you are currently taking.

8. Then you will start taking one study pill every morning.  You will either get THX333 pills or placebo pills (pills that have no effect).  You will not know which kind of pills you are taking, and neither will your doctors or your parents, until the end of the study.

9. During the 16 weeks of the study, you will need to visit the clinic at least 11 more times for physical exams and blood tests.  Each visit will last 1 to 3 hours.

10. Your parents will help make sure you take the study pills, and they will be asked more questions about you throughout the study.

   When the study ends:
11. You and your parents will be able to find out whether you were getting the THX333 pills or the placebo pills.  

If you were getting the THX333 pills and they seemed to be helping you, your regular doctor might be able to prescribe something like THX333 after the study ends.  But no children or adolescents will be able to get THX333 for ADHD outside the study because it is still being tested.

Will any parts of this study hurt or have other risks?
Blood drawing may hurt when the needle is put into and taken out of your arm.  You will be asked if you want to use a numbing medicine on your skin to try to make it hurt less.

Sometimes when the sticky patches for the ECG are taken off they can hurt a little bit, like when a bandage is pulled off your skin.

You may have side effects from the study medicine.  If you feel any side effects, you should tell your parents or the study doctor about this right away.

If you were taking medicine for your ADHD before, and you get the placebo pills in the study, it might turn out the placebo pills don't help you as much as your old medicine did.

Will you get better if you are in this study?
We don't know if this study will make you feel better. You may get a little better by being in this study, or you may stay the same, or you may get worse.

What if you have questions?
You can ask Dr. Chavez, Dr. Wong, Dr. McSweeney, or the people who work with them any questions you have about the study.  You can ask your questions now or later, any time you like.  You can also ask your parents to ask questions for you.

What are your choices?
If your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to. But you don't have to be in it if you don't want to.  Nobody will get mad at you if you don't want to do this.  

If you don't want to be in the study, you can continue the medication that you take now.  Or if you don't take any medication right now, your doctor may be able to find an available medication that works for you. Or you may not want any medication now.

If you decide to be in the study now and you change your mind later, that's okay, too.  
You just have to tell the study doctor or the study staff as soon as you change your mind, and you will be taken out of the study.
