Consent Form Module: Genetic Testing, Version: June 1, 2014
This module outlines the purpose, risks, benefits, and confidentiality of records for genetic research/testing as part of a larger study.

G1. GENETIC TESTING

Genetic testing is done on blood and other specimens. In this study, we will do genetic testing on your <blood or specimen>. This will be collected <identify method and timeframe>. Genetic testing will be done because <include reason for genetic testing>.

This genetic study is for research only. The purpose is not to discover information that could be used to change your medical care, make or change your diagnosis, or advise you on your risk of diseases. 

Will the item for genetic testing will be identified or de-identified? Choose one statement and delete the other.
Information that can identify you will be attached to your <blood or specimen>. The study team will make every effort to protect the information and keep it confidential, but it is possible that an unauthorized person might see it. Depending on the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could embarrass you. It is against federal law (GINA) for health insurance companies to deny health insurance, or large employers to deny jobs, based on your genetic information. But the same law does not protect your ability to get disability, life, or long term care insurance. If you have questions, you can talk to the study doctor about whether this could apply to you.

Information that can identify you will not be attached to your <blood or specimen>
