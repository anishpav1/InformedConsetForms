Informed Consent for Genetic Testing
Patient’s Name:___________________________________________

Patient’s ID Number: ______________________________________

Patient’s Date of Birth:_____________________________________

Ordering Provider’s Name:_________________________________

Note to the Ordering Health Care Provider: Some states require that patients (or their authorized representatives) provide their written
informed consent prior to receiving genetic testing, and that the ordering health care provider maintain documentation of the informed
consent in the patient’s medical record. This form is intended to assist you with obtaining the patient’s informed consent in accordance
with applicable law.
As the patient/patient’s authorized representative, I understand the
following and freely give my consent to this genetic testing:

•	 General description and purpose of the test — My health
care provider has recommended that I (or my child) receive the
following genetic test:____________________________________
_____________________________________________________ .

•	 My health care provider has explained that the purpose of this
test is to look for mutations or genetic alterations known to be
associated with the following genetic disease(s), condition(s), or
pharmaceutical therapy:__________________________________
_____________________________________________________ .
I have reviewed information about this specific test and the
relevant disease(s) or condition(s) tested for with my health
care provider, and my health care provider has explained the
test’s risks and benefits. (Test-specific information is available
on the LabCorp or LabCorp affiliate web site at
https://www.labcorp.com).

•	 Limitations of the test — This test analyzes specific gene
regions and does not rule out the possibility of an undetected
variant in other gene regions. Donor DNA from transplants
and recent transfusions can lead to inaccurate results. As in any
laboratory test, there is a possibility of error.

•	 Availability of genetic counseling before and after

testing — I have been provided with information about
obtaining genetic counseling prior to giving my consent for this
testing. I further understand that my health care provider may
recommend consultation with a medical geneticist, genetic
counselor, and/or a physician after the testing is completed.

•	 Meaning of a positive test result — A positive test result is an
indication that I (or my child) may be predisposed to or have
the specific disease(s) or condition(s) tested for. I may wish
to consider further independent testing and/or to consult a
physician or genetic counselor. I further understand that the
ability of genetic testing to provide risk information and the level
of certainty associated with a positive test result vary with the
type of test. If applicable, I have been provided with information
about the level of certainty of a positive result for this test.

•	 Meaning of a negative test result — A negative test result
indicates that the clinically significant variant tested was not
detected. Negative results may also be due to: (1) maternal
contamination of prenatal samples; (2) technical reasons (ie,
poor sample quality); and/or (3) the need to test other family
members. I have discussed information about the detection rate
for the disease(s)/condition(s) with my health care provider and
understand that a negative result does not guarantee that I
(or my child) will not develop the disease/condition for which
testing was performed.

•	 Additional acknowledgments concerning the results of

prenatal testing — I understand that normal or negative test
results do not guarantee the birth of a child without the specific
disease or birth defect for which testing was performed. In
addition, a percentage of all pregnancies have birth defects that
cannot be detected by testing chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, or by
ultrasound examination. In the case of twins or other multiple
fetuses, the results may pertain to only one of the fetuses. In the
case of abnormal or positive test results, the decision to continue
or to terminate the pregnancy is entirely mine.

•	 Disclosure of test results — All tests are confidential and will be
disclosed only to the ordering health care provider (or his or her
designated representative) unless otherwise authorized by the
patient in writing or required by law.

•	 Retention of specimens — No tests other than those authorized
by my health care provider will be performed on my (or my child’s)
sample. The sample will be destroyed at the end of the testing
process or not more than 60 days after the sample was taken,
unless I expressly authorize a longer period of retention in writing.
Your signature below indicates that you understand to your
satisfaction the information about the genetic testing ordered
by your health care provider and that you consent to having this
testing performed.
