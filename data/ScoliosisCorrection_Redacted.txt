procedures.
3. My doctors have explained the RISKS OF THE PROCEDURES and I understand them. The major risks are listed on
page 3.
4. I understand the planned location of my procedures may be marked on my body before the procedures. It may also

5. I understand that if I am given ANESTHESIA OR SEDATION ANALGESIA there will be other risks. These risks
include severe blood loss, infection, damage to teeth, mouth, throat, or vocal cords, nerve or eye damage, drug
reaction, slowing or stopping of breathing, failure of the anesthetic or sedation analgesia, cardiac arrest, risks that
cannot be predicted, permanent disability or even death. There may be other unknown risks. I understand these risks
and I consent to the use of any anesthetic or sedation analgesia that my doctors or the anesthetists believe is
necessary.
6. I understand that blood and urine specimens will need to be collected in order to determine my care. If I am a

anonymous specimens.
10. I request and authorize the
and any doctors, nurses, medical residents and other trainees,

CONSENT FOR USE OF BLOOD OR BLOOD COMPONENTS
1.

I understand I may need a transfusion during my procedure. Reasons for transfusion will be for one or more reasons
that may include: to correct anemia, to increase oxygen delivery to my body, to treat a blood clot, or to prevent
bleeding. My provider has told me what a blood transfusion is and how it will be done. The blood products that may be
used include:
(1) Red Blood Cells
(3) Plasma/cryoprecipitate
(5) Stem cells
(2) Platelets
(4) Granulocytes
(6) Mononuclear cells

2.

The risks of a transfusion include:
(1) Common Reactions that usually are not dangerous: bruising, fever, chills, rash or hives
(2) Less Common But More Serious Reactions, especially if I have heart disease: kidney failure, heart
failure or shortness of breath (kidney or heart failure may lead to death).
(3) Very Rare But Possibly Life Threatening (less than 1 in 100,000): getting an infectious disease, like
hepatitis or HIV/AIDS, bacterial infection, breakdown of transfused blood by my immune system, lung
injury or death.

3.

My provider has explained the potential benefits of a transfusion, and the risks of refusing a transfusion. I understand
there may be alternatives to allogeneic (blood bank) transfusion, depending on my condition and the time involved,
and that each of these has its own risks, which also have been explained. These include:
(1) Growth factors or Iron: these products take days or months to replace or increase blood cells.
(2) Autologous blood: my own blood that I donate before surgery, or that is salvaged during surgery.
(3) Directed donors: blood donated by people I choose (Requires at least 3-4 days and must be compatible
with the patient and is not safer than volunteer donors. The directed donor’s blood can pose additional
risks if the direct donor is a first-degree relative. Additional risks may include acute lung injury, reactions
due to antibodies and graft versus host disease.).

4.

uses blood obtained from Food and Drug Administration licensed and registered blood establishments, who
test for infectious agents.
does not do its own testing and makes no guarantees about the blood products.

5.

I understand the risks and potential benefits of a transfusion and I want to receive any medically necessary
transfusions during my course of treatment.unless I initial my refusal on page 3.
Provider: List any exceptions under the Exceptions section located on page 3.
CONSENT FOR TISSUE IMPLANTS

1. The procedures listed on page 3 may include replacement of lost or damaged tissue. Tissue might include: bone,
ligaments, tendons, fascia, cartilage, cornea and sclera, skin, veins and arteries, heart valves, pericardium, or dura
matter.
2. Each of the following options for replacement of lost or damaged tissue has risks. My provider has explained these
risks. These include:
(1) Autograft – tissue from another part of my body for repair. Risks include increased anesthesia time,
infection, transfer failure, or two surgical sites.
(2) Allograft – tissue obtained from a human donor. Risks include communicable disease such as hepatitis,
HIV/AIDS, or CJD (the human form of mad cow disease), infection, or implant failure.
(3) Synthetic materials – artificially prepared human and non-human based. Risks include communicable
disease such as hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, or CJD (the human form of mad cow disease), infection, possible
blood thinning medication, or foreign material rejection.
(4) Xenograft – animal tissue. Risks include infection, immune rejection, or viral infection.
3. I understand that
uses tissue obtained from Food and Drug Administration registered tissue establishments
which must screen donors and perform testing for communicable disease.
does not do its own testing and
makes no guarantees about the tissue implants.
4. I understand the risks and potential benefits of a tissue implant. I want to receive any medically necessary tissue
implants during my course of treatment.

Excluded Sites: Check here if the operative site is considered an excluded site.
Excluded sites are as follows:
 Mid-line sternotomy for a non-sided organ (e.g., CABG)
 Cesarean deliveries
 Surgery through a body orifice that does NOT involve laterality of the organ
(e.g., Cystoscopy)
 Laparotomy, laparoscopy that does NOT involve laterality of the organ (e.g.,
splenectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy)
 Interventional procedures for which the site of insertion is NOT
predetermined, such as cardiac catheterization procedures, angiography,
and dialysis catheters
 Breast biopsy with wire localization
 Intra-oral and dental procedures
 Premature infants, for whom the mark may cause a permanent tattoo
 Marking for superficial cosmetic procedures using lasers (or similar energybased devices) or injectables (such as neurotoxins and soft tissue fillers)
when there are multiple sites and/or when marking would be impractical or
pose a potential adverse outcome to the procedure.
