GENERAL DENTISTRY CONSENT FORM FOR ZYSIK FAMILY DENTAL
PATIENT NAME___________________________________________
Dentistry is not an exact science and reputable practitioners cannot properly guarantee results. Despite the most diligent care and
precaution, unanticipated complications or unintended results, although rare, may occur. A treatment plan is based on the best
evidence available during the examination. There is no guarantee that this plan will not change. During treatment, it may be necessary
to change or add procedures because of conditions that were not evident during examination, but were found during the course of
treatment. For ex: root canal treatment may be needed during routine restorative procedures. Any change in treatment plan may result
in additional fees.
Guarantees and assurances cannot be made by anyone regarding the dental treatment which you have requested and authorized. It is
essential that you keep your appointments and cooperate in your treatment to help insure the best possible result. Please read the
following, initial and sign.

Fillings- Care must be exercised in chewing on filled teeth, especially on large fillings and during the first 24 hours, to avoid
breakage. A more extensive restorative procedure than originally diagnosed may be necessary, due to more decay than
anticipated. Sensitivity can occur following a newly placed filling and will go away with time.
Initial_____________
Crowns, Bridges and Laminates- These restorations involve permanent alteration of the tooth structure. It is not always
possible to match the color of the natural teeth exactly with artificial teeth. Temporary restorations may come off easily. Care
must be taken to insure that they are kept on until the permanent restorations are delivered. The final opportunity to make
changes to the new crown, bridges or laminates (including the shape, fit, size and color) will be before cementation. Excess
delays may allow for tooth movement, necessitating remaking of the restoration and additional charges may be incurred.
Initial_____________
Dentures Full and Partial- The wearing of dentures can be difficult. Sore spots, altered speech and difficulty in eating are
common problems. Due to jaw ridge loss, retention of full dentures can be a problem. Immediate dentures may require
considerable adjusting and several relines. A permanent reline will be needed later (this is not included in the denture fee). You
are responsible to return for delivery of the dentures. Failure to do so may result in poorly fitting dentures and remakes will
require additional charges. Failure to wear partial dentures every day will likely lead to tooth movement, resulting in a partial
that no longer fits.
Initial______________
Periodontal Disease- Periodontal disease affects the gums and bone which support the teeth. It is a serious, progressive
infection, causing breakdown of the gums and bone and eventual loss of teeth. It is best treated in its early stage. Treatment
options may include gum surgery, extractions and replacements. Undertaking any dental procedure may have a future adverse
effect on the periodontia.
Initial______________
Endodontic treatment (Root Canal) - Although over 90% effective, there is no guarantee that root canal treatment will succeed
and complications can occur from the treatment. Endodontic files and reamers are very fine instruments and can separate
during use. Additional surgical procedures may be necessary following root canal treatment. Despite all efforts to save it, the
tooth may still be lost.
Initial _______________
Removal of Teeth (Extractions) - Teeth may need to be extracted for various reasons, such as non-restorability, lack of bone
support, part of orthodontic treatment, impactions, etc. There are alternatives to the removal of treatable teeth and these
options include root canal therapy, periodontal treatment and crowns. Removal of teeth does not always remove the infection,
if present, and further treatment may be necessary. There are risks involved in having teeth removed, including , but not
limited to pain, swelling, spread of infection, dry socket, loss of feeling in the teeth, lips, tongue and surrounding tissue (which
is usually temporary, but in rare cases is permanent), sinus involvement and jaw fracture. If complications arise during or
following treatment, referral to a specialist may be needed, requiring further treatment and additional cost.
Initial_______________
Drugs, Medications, and Anesthetics- Antibiotics, analgesics, natural supplements and other medications can cause allergic
reactions such as redness and swelling of tissue, pain, itching, vomiting and/or anaphylactic shock. Injections of local
anesthetics can cause paresthesia (numbness) of teeth, lips and surrounding tissues. Though quite rare, this numbness can
sometimes be permanent. Studies have shown that Bisphosphonate (ex. Fosomax) therapy for osteoporosis can compromise
treatment results.
