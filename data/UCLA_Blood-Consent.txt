BLOOD TRANSFUSION
INFORMED CONSENT INFORMATION

(Patient Label)

The purpose of this document is to provide written information regarding the risks, benefits and
alternatives of transfusion of blood or primary components of blood (including, without limitation
red blood cells, plasma, platelets, or others collected from the patient (autologous) or another
person (allogeneic)). This material serves as a supplement to the discussion you have with your
physician. It is important that you fully understand this information, so please read this document
thoroughly. If you have any questions regarding the procedure, ask your physician prior to signing
the consent form. We appreciate your selecting UCLA Health to meet your needs.
Information about the Treatment
Reason for treatment (diagnosis, condition, or indication)
 Transfusions of blood or blood products (components of blood including red blood cells,
plasma, platelets, or others) are provided to increase the amount of these blood products in
your blood stream when they are below a reasonable level for your health.
Brief description of the treatment
 Transfusions are given by vein (usually a vein in the arm) using a new sterile disposable
needle. The transfusion may be made up of red blood cells, plasma, platelets or other
specialized products made from blood. Your doctor will decide on the right amount and type of
blood product based on your medical condition or diagnosis.
Potential benefits of the treatment
Transfusion of blood or blood products may be necessary to correct low levels of blood
components in your body, and may also make you feel better. In some cases, failure to receive
transfusion(s) may result in death.
Risks and side effects of the treatment
Known risks of this treatment include, but are not limited to:
 Infection or irritation where the needle is placed.
 Temporary reaction such as a fever, chills, or skin rashes.
 Other rare but more serious complications may occur such as allergic reactions, heart failure
due to fluid overload, acute pulmonary edema (fluid leaking into the lungs), shock, or death.
Transfusions of blood or blood products involve a small risk of transmission of diseases such as
Hepatitis B (~1 in 1,000,000), Hepatitis C (~1 in 1,200,000), and HIV/AIDS (~1 in 1,500,000).
There is also a small risk of bacterial infection when blood products are transfused.
Alternatives
Blood or blood products are donated by volunteer community donors. These donors are
extensively screened about their health history and undergo numerous blood tests as mandated by
the FDA in order to ensure the safest possible blood supply. Other options for the source of blood
products are auto-donation (using your own previously donated blood), directed donation (blood
donated by people whom you have asked to donate for you), and intra-operative salvage (your
own blood collected during surgery). These options may be available if your health, time, and
procedure permit. In addition, medications may be used to reduce the need for blood products.
You may also choose not to have any treatment; however, this decision may hold life-threatening
consequences.
