CONSENT FOR ADMISSION & CARE/HOSPICE BENEFIT ELECTION
Hospice #_____________________
P. O. Box 4860 * Ocala, FL 34478-4860 * (352) 873-7400

I,_________________________________________________ hereby consent to admission and care by Hospice of Marion
County, Inc., Inc. (HMC) I acknowledge and consent to the following:
I understand HMC's goal is palliative care and not to cure my life limiting illness. HMC does not discriminate regardless of
diagnosis, race, national origin, age, gender, religious affiliation, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or the ability to pay for
service rendered.
HOSPICE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM: Hospice services are provided by an interdisciplinary team which includes: my
physician, a patient care coordinator, nurses, social workers, chaplains, volunteers, home health aides, bereavement staff, and
the Hospice Medical Directors. These services are provided both on a scheduled basis and as needed 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. I have been informed of my right to choose my attending physician, and I hereby request my attending physician to be:

 Community Physician Dr._________________________________________________________________________
 HMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Mery Lossada, or other HMC Medical Director
An HMC Medical Director will assume responsibility for my medical needs if my attending physician is unavailable.
PLAN OF CARE: The parties acknowledge that HMC has been chosen to provide hospice services to my family and me,
along with the hospice team. A plan of care will be developed based on our needs, which will be reviewed regularly. I can
review my plan of care and will participate in decisions related to my care. I understand the focus of my care will be to
maintain me in my own home. I understand if I am to receive full benefits of hospice care it is important for me to make my
needs and concerns known to the hospice staff. I will actively participate in plans for my care.
TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES: I consent to all treatments and procedures to include a physical assessment that are
on my plan of care as related to my life limiting illness.
RELEASE OF INFORMATION: I authorize HMC to release any necessary information including medical records that are
applicable, including mental health, substance abuse and/or Human Immunodeficiency Virus – AIDS. These records will be
released as required to other health care providers to assure continuity of care, reimbursement, quality assurance, utilization
review, and as required by law, regulatory agencies and accrediting bodies.
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: HMC uses Palliative Care Pharmacy, a division of HMC to provide the medication related to my
life limiting illness as defined in my individualized plan of care. I give consent for my medication to be ordered from the
Palliative Care Pharmacy. I understand that due to DEA and Law Enforcement concerns, as well as recurring manufacturing
shortages, HMC maintains a limited selection of controlled substances, which will be provided per physician order as required
by my plan of care. Further, I understand that generic and therapeutic substitution(s) of my current medications may be
required. I understand that all hospice provided medications no longer in use will be disposed of properly by law or regulatory
requirements. I give consent for HMC to exchange information with my community pharmacy related to my medications and
hospice diagnosis. I understand that if I have Medicare Part D drug coverage, my pharmacy must bill all of my medications to
HMC, who will work with my physician and pharmacy to determine whether my medications will be covered under the
hospice benefit or by my Medicare Part D plan. If a medication is determined by the hospice physician to be related to the
terminal illness but not medically necessary for pain and/or symptom management, hospice will not pay for the medication.
This medication also will not be covered by my Medicare Part D plan. I understand that if I want to continue taking the
medication that I will need to pay for it out of pocket unless I have coverage from another insurer. If I request a medication
that is not on the hospice formulary and I refuse to try a medication that HMC believes will be as effective and is on the
hospice formulary, I understand that my Medicare Part D plan will not pay for this medication, and I will have to pay for it out
of pocket.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES: I understand that the Federal Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 requires that I be made
aware of my right to make healthcare decisions for myself and my preference for life sustaining treatment. I may express my
wishes in a document called an Advance Directive so my wishes may be known when I am unable to speak for myself. I have
made an Advance Directive  Yes
 No
Copy of Advance Directive requested:  POA for Health Care
 HCS
 Living Will  DNR
Copy of Advance Directive received:  POA for Health Care
 HCS
 Living Will  DNR
I have been informed that under Florida law having a Living Will is not sufficient to avoid the use of life support methods if
911 is called or an ambulance transports.

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND REIMBURSEMENT: For those eligible patients, Medicare and Medicaid pays
for all care and services related to the terminal illness as established by the hospice interdisciplinary Plan of Care. HMC may
bill me for those services/supplies not paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance. Services not covered by Medicare,
Medicaid, or insurance will be confirmed in writing by HMC. I will be responsible for the costs of any treatment or
services/supplies provided, treatments for conditions not related to my life limiting illness and for any treatments for my life
limiting illness which are NOT part of the hospice plan of care or not PRE-AUTHORIZED by HMC. I agree to a financial
statement and to complete all needed forms.

MEDICARE BENEFIT ELECTION: I choose to elect the Hospice Medicare benefit to receive hospice care from HMC. I
understand HMC's goal is palliative care and not to cure my life limiting illness. By choosing Hospice Medicare, I am giving
up payment for other Medicare service benefits. Only HMC will be able to receive Medicare payment for care or services
provided to me for my terminal illness or any other condition related to my terminal illness. Exceptions to this are:
a.
Medicare will make payment for physician services if my attending physician is not a hospice employee or is not
receiving any payments from hospice.
b.
Medicare will make payments for services provided to me by another hospice when services are arranged through
Hospice of Marion County, Inc., where allowed by Medicare regulations.
c.
Medicare will make payment for hospice care according to benefit periods. These benefit periods are as follows:
First Benefit Period - 90 Days, Second Benefit Period - 90 Days, Unlimited number of subsequent 60 Day periods
I can choose not to continue my hospice care at any time. To discontinue care, I must complete a revocation statement. I can
obtain this statement from any HMC employee.
If I revoke my Hospice Medicare Benefit in the middle of a benefit period, I give up the remaining days in the benefit period.
For example, if I revoke my Hospice Medicare Benefit after the first 10 days, I give up the remaining 80 days in the first
benefit period. If I revoke the Medicare Benefit during a subsequent 60 day period, I will forfeit the remaining days in that
period. A new 60 day period may be elected at a later date.
While on Hospice Medicare Benefits, I can choose to receive hospice care from another hospice program at any time during
the Medicare Benefit periods. Only one change per benefit period is allowed. More than one change will start a new benefit
period. To change programs, I must first confirm that the hospice I wish to be admitted to can admit me and on what date. I
must inform HMC of my wishes so arrangements for transfer can be made. I then must document the date I wish to
discontinue care from HMC, the name of the Hospice from which I wish to receive care, and the date that care will start.
