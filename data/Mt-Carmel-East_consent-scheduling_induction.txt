Total Score:

With a Bishop Score of less than or equal to 8, there is an increased rate of Cesarean Section in nulliparous women. If the
total score is greater than 8, the probability of vaginal delivery after labor induction is similar to that of spontaneous labor.

INDUCTION INFORMED CONSENT:

My physician has discussed the need, risks and benefits of an induction. I have been advised as to the reasonable alternative,
possible consequences of remaining untreated, and risks and possible complications of each alternative. In particular, with
induction, there is a potential for a longer labor and increased chance of Cesarean Section. I understand the information that has
been presented to me regarding the induction of labor and all my questions about the induction have been answered.

My physician has discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives of a scheduled delivery of my baby at 36 0/7-38 6/7 weeks.

Induction Scheduling Guidelines

A Manama! 3mm

Purpose: To provide guidance in scheduling and prioritizing of inductions. Induction is defined as the initiation of labor in a patient in
whom active labor has not been documented.

1 .

To schedule an induction, the physician/office staff will call Labor & Delivery (MCSA 898-4220, MCW 234-5089,

MCE 234-6525) for an induction date and time. The physician must complete the Induction Informed Consent and Scheduling
Form and fax it to L&D within 24 hours of the call. The induction is not considered scheduled until L&D receives the form.
Informed Consent must also be obtained prior to the scheduled induction (available on the Induction Informed Consent and
Scheduling form) and faxed to Labor and Delivery. If a consent is not obtained prior to the procedure, the physician will be
notified by the Labor and Delivery staff and one will need to be completed prior to the initiation of the induction. Please fax to:
(614) 234-8128

Inductions may be scheduled up to 7 days prior to the patient's planned admission. If a physician desires to add on an induction

for the day, the physician must call the L&D charge nurse for a time. No patient will be denied an induction if medically
indicated.

When a request is received to schedule more than the allotted number of inductions on the same day, it will be necessary to
prioritize which patients need to be induced first. Medical inductions will take priority over elective inductions. If more than one
patient is being induced for medical indications, the following list will be used to prioritize which patients need to be induced first:

Gestational Hypertension Macrosomia (EFW greater than 4500 gms) Gestational Age greater
Preeclampsia/Eclampsia Postdates (41-42 weeks) than or equal to 39 weeks.

Abruptio placenta Gestational Diabetes History of rapid delivery

Bleeding D/T Marginal Placental Previa lUGR-reassuring testing Distance from hospital
Non-Reassuring fetal testing Fetal Demise Term with a favorable cervix
Maternal Medical Conditions History of HSV Psychological Factors

Fetal Compromise (IUGR) Multiples Positive GBBS with a favorable cervix

Oligohydraminos

Postdates greater than 42 weeks

Blood group sensitization

Fetal Hydrops

Chorioamnionitis

PROM

If it is necessary to delay an induction, the following steps will be taken:

a) The charge nurse will notify the physician of the delay and an approximate time for admission. The physician may approve a
later start time for that day or elect to reschedule.

b) The patient will be notified by the charge nurse or physician, as appropriate, of the delay.

c) Medically indicated induction will be given priority. Elective inductions will be delayed based upon the order in which they
were scheduled (last scheduled, first delayed).

d) Elective inductions may be rescheduled or delayed, based on unit census and staffing.

If a concern exists about the prioritization of patients to be induced, the physician may request the L&D Unit Director or L&D
Clinical Manager to review the Induction Informed Consent and Schedulinq Form completed for each patient scheduled to be
induced. In an attempt to resolve the issue the Unit Director/Clinical Manager may talk to the providers involved or the
Department Chair.
