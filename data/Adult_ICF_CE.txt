The following language in the Introduction section must be included in the ICF:

Taking part in this research study is entirely your choice. You can decide to refuse to participate in this study. If you decide to participate in this study, you can then choose to stop taking part in the study at any time for any reason. If you refuse to participate in the study or stop being in this study, it will not affect your care or treatment outside this study, payment for your health care, or your health care benefits. 

Please read all of the following information carefully. Ask _______, or his/her representative, to explain any words, terms, or sections that are unclear to you. Ask any questions that you have about this study.  Do not sign this consent form unless you understand the information in it and have had your questions answered to your satisfaction.  

If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be asked to sign this form. You will be given a copy of the signed form. You should keep your copy for your records. It has information, including important names and telephone numbers, to which you may wish to refer in the future.

New things might be learned during this study that you should know about. The investigators will tell you about new information that may affect your willingness to stay in this study. 

If you are eligible to participate and decide to be in the study, the Principal Investigator may still choose to stop your participation in this study if she/he thinks it is in your best medical interest.  Also state other reasons why a subject may be withdrawn from the study.

If you have question about your rights as a research study subject, call the Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) at (617) 636-7512. The IRB is a group of doctors, nurses, and non-medical people who review human research studies for safety and protection of people who take part in the studies. Federal law requires the IRB to review and approve any research study involving humans. This must be done before the study can begin. The study is also reviewed on a regular basis while it is in progress.

This research study has been reviewed and approved by the IRB of Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University Health Sciences.
