Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is a
long, narrow tube (catheter) about the same size as a
strand of long spaghetti. It is used to give you
medication directly into your blood stream without
having to repeatedly insert a needle into your vein.
Using ultrasound as a guide the needle will be
inserted into your vein.
Once the catheter has entered into your vein, it is
passed along the vein using X-ray guidance.
The tip of the PICC will be positioned in one of the
major blood vessel next to the heart. When the
catheter is in the correct place a chest x-ray will be
taken to confirm its placement.
This procedure will require the injection of a local
anaesthetic. A sedative injection is rarely given.

C. Risks of the procedure

SW9266

F

I

In recommending the PICC, the doctor believes the
benefits to you from having this procedure exceed the
risks involved.
The risks and complications with this procedure and
with having a PICC can include but are not limited to
the following.
Common risks and complications include:
 Minor pain, bruising and/or infection at the
insertion site. This may require treatment with
antibiotics.
 Bleeding or bruising may occur. This is usually
stopped by applying pressure and/or ice to the
puncture site. This is more common if you take
Aspirin, Warfarin, Clopidogrel (Plavix and Iscover)
or Dipyridamole (Persantin and Asasantin).
 The PICC may become kinked or blocked. The
PICC may need to be re-positioned and/ or
medication given to unblock the catheter

or tugged on. The PICC may need to be reinserted.
 Failure of local anaesthetic which may require a
further injection of anaesthetic or a different
method of anaesthesia may be used.
 Nerve damage, is usually temporary, and should
get better over a period of time. Permanent nerve
damage is rare.
Less common risks and complications include:
 Infection at the skin puncture site, requiring
antibiotics and/or further treatment.
 Infection in the catheter, requiring the removal of
the PICC.
 Damage to surrounding structures such as blood
vessels, organs and muscles, requiring further
treatment.
 Irritation and pain in the vein from the PICC, the
medications injected or from infection. The PICC
may need to be removed.
 Blood clot blocking the vein may require
medication to treat.
 An allergy to injected drugs, requiring further
treatment.
 Difficulty or inability to advance/insert the PICC
may be due to small vessels, vasospasm,
stenosis or difficult anatomy.
 The procedure may not be possible due to
medical and/or technical reasons.
Rare risks and complications include:
 Injected medications may leak outside of the vein,
under the skin and into the fat tissues, this may
require treatment.
 A fast or irregular heart beat. Usually resolves on
it’s own but sometimes may need further
treatment.
 The tip of the PICC may move from the original
placement, this will require repositioning or
removal.
 An air bubble enters the blood stream. This can
travel to the heart causing a heart attack or to the
brain causing a stroke.
 An increased lifetime cancer risk due to the
exposure to x-rays.
 Seizures and/or cardiac arrest due to local
anaesthetic toxicity.
 Death as a result of this procedure is very rare.

PICC- Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter
1. What is a PICC?

4. During the procedure

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is a
long, narrow tube (catheter) about the same size as a
strand of long spaghetti. It is used to give you
medication directly into your blood stream without
having to repeatedly insert a needle into your vein.
Blood samples can also be taken through the PICC for
testing.
A PICC can be left in place for weeks or months
depending on your treatment.
This procedure is performed in medical imaging with
guidance from imaging machines such as ultrasound
and x-ray. For more information on these imaging
methods and the risks involved in their use, please
read the Ultrasound Patient Information Sheet (if
you do not have this information sheet please ask for
one).

Ultrasound will be used to look at your veins and a
suitable vein for the catheter will be selected.
Local anaesthetic will be injected into the skin around
the selected vein.
Using ultrasound as a guide the needle will be
inserted into your vein.
You must remain as still as possible.
Once the catheter has entered into your vein, it is
passed along the vein using X-ray guidance.
At this time, you may be asked to turn your head to
face the arm where the PICC is being inserted. This
helps guide the catheter into the right place.
The tip of the PICC will be positioned in one of the
major blood vessel next to the heart. The catheter
does not go into your heart. You will not feel the
catheter inside your body.
When the catheter is in the correct place a chest x-ray
will be taken to confirm its placement.

5. After the procedure
At the end of the procedure, a dressing will be applied
to your arm where the catheter exits your vein. There
are usually no stitches holding the catheter in place.
You must be careful not to pull or tug the PICC.
Once placement of the PICC has been confirmed by a
Radiologist (x-ray doctor), it can be used straight
away.
Following your PICC insertion it is normal to
experience some redness and tenderness in the area
of the insertion for about 24 to 48 hours.
You will be educated about your PICC, how to take
care of it and the recommended level of activity
advised while it is in place.

2. Will there be any discomfort, is any
anaesthetic needed?
This procedure will require an injection of a local
anaesthetic. It is used to prevent or relieve pain, but
will not put you to sleep.
You should feel no more than mild discomfort.

03/2011 - v3.00

3. Preparation for the procedure
The medical imaging department will give you
instructions on how to prepare for your procedure.
 Please tell the staff if you are or suspect you
might be pregnant or are breastfeeding.
 If you take Aspirin, Warfarin, Clopidogrel (Plavix
and Iscover) or Dipyridamole (Persantin and
Asasantin) or any other drug that is used to thin
your blood ask your doctor/health practitioner if
you should stop taking it before the procedure as
it may affect your blood clotting.

6. What are the risks of this specific
procedure?
The risks and complications with this procedure and
with having a PICC can include but are not limited to
the following.
Common risks and complications include:
 Minor pain, bruising and/or infection at the
insertion site. This may require treatment with
antibiotics.
 Bleeding or bruising may occur. This is usually
stopped by applying pressure and/or ice to the
puncture site. This is more common if you take
Aspirin, Warfarin, Clopidogrel (Plavix and Iscover)
or Dipyridamole (Persantin and Asasantin).
 The PICC may become kinked or blocked.
 The PICC may be accidentally removed if pulled
or tugged on.
 Failure of local anaesthetic which may require a
further injection of anaesthetic or a different
method of anaesthesia may be used.

Consent Information - Patient Copy
Ultrasound
1. What is an Ultrasound?
Ultrasound scans assess internal organs and help to
diagnose a variety of conditions. They are also
performed to assess disease in the arteries or veins.
An Ultrasound machine is made up of a console
containing a computer, a display screen and a probe
(transducer). The probe is a small hand-held device
that resembles a microphone.
Ultrasound pictures are produced by passing
ultrasonic (high frequency) soundwaves into the area
being scanned.
Ultrasound does not use x-rays.

2. Will there be any discomfort, is any
anaesthetic needed?

If you are having an intimate examination the staff
will describe the procedure to you, and your verbal
consent for this will be obtained.
A second staff member may also be in the room
during these procedures.

5. What are the risks of this specific
procedure?
There are no known risks from an ultrasound. It is
considered to be a very safe procedure.

Notes to talk to my doctor/ health practitioner
about:
...........................................................................................................................................................................

An Ultrasound is a painless procedure. No
anaesthetic is required.
If scanning is performed over an area of tenderness,
you may feel pressure or minor discomfort from the
probe.

...........................................................................................................................................................................

...........................................................................................................................................................................

...........................................................................................................................................................................

...........................................................................................................................................................................

3. Preparation for the procedure

...........................................................................................................................................................................

There are different preparations required depending
on the area of the body being scanned. The medical
imaging department will give you instructions on how
to prepare for your scan.

...........................................................................................................................................................................

...........................................................................................................................................................................

...........................................................................................................................................................................

03/2011 - v2.00

4. During the procedure

...........................................................................................................................................................................

The lights in the room will be dimmed so that the
pictures on the screen can be seen more clearly.
A gel will be applied to your skin over the area to be
scanned. The gel allows the probe to slide easily over
the skin and helps produce clearer pictures.
The probe will be moved back and forth slowly over
the area of interest until the area is completely
examined.
You could be asked to hold you breath or roll into
different positions during the scan.
Once the scan is complete, the gel will be wiped off
your skin.
The Ultrasound will take between 15 and 60 minutes.
This time frame is dependent on what body part is
being scanned and the type of investigation is
required.
In some ultrasound studies, the probe is inserted into
a natural opening in the body.
These procedures include:
- Transrectal Ultrasound where the probe is
inserted into a man’s rectum to view the
prostate.
- Transvaginal Ultrasound where the probe is
inserted into a woman’s vagina to view the
uterus and ovaries.
These procedures may cause minimal discomfort.
