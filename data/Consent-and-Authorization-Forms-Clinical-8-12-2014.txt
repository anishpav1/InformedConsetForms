Clinical Research Consent and Authorization Form

TITLE: Title of the study.  Use the same title as that on the Initial Review Questionnaire (IRQ).


PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####
CO-INVESTIGATORS:	[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####
The Principal Investigator (PI) must be listed on the consent form. Listing co-investigators on the consent form is optional.  It is recommended that you limit the number of co-investigators listed here by only listing those most likely to conduct the consent discussion.  

FUNDED BY:  List all organizations/entities providing monetary support for the study, regardless of whether funds are received directly or through another organization (such as a cooperative group or foundation).

SUPPORTED BY:   List any organizations/entities providing non-monetary support only, such as a free study drug.

Device studies must include (optional for other studies): OHSU is being compensated by the funder to conduct this study.  This is to pay for tests performed only for study purposes, and for the time involved on the part of the investigator(s) and study staff.  You may freely discuss this with your physician and the investigator if you have concerns.

Device studies with NO investigator conflict of interest, also state the following.  If conflict of interest statement is required, use that instead (see below):  Your study doctor and the research staff have no financial involvement with the funder and are not being paid directly by the funder for conducting this study.  However, they may have travel expenses covered by the funder to attend study training meetings.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  All potential conflicts of interest in research (CoIR) must be disclosed and evaluated by the COI committee.  After evaluation, the COI committee may require specific language to be inserted into the consent form.  If directed, place the language here.  For more information on CoIR, visit: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/about/integrity/coi/

PURPOSE:
If the study includes both children and adults and all procedures are identical for both children and adults, state: "You" means you or your child in this consent form.  (For other studies involving children, address the consent form to the parent referring to children as "your child.") 

Include and complete the following sentences: You have been invited to be in this research study because __________.  [For example, "you have asthma."]  The purpose of this study is to __________.  [For example, "learn about an investigational drug that may help treat asthma."] 

Without suggesting the investigative drug or treatment is superior to standard care, explain why the particular drug or treatment is being studied.  What problem does the study try to solve? For example: The study drug may cause fewer side effects than drugs currently used to treat asthma. 

If applicable, specify that an investigational (experimental) device, procedure, or drug is to be used.  Sample language (modify to fit your study):  Right now, this drug is not approved for use for asthma in the United States because we do not know enough about it.

State how long the study will last.  Sample language (modify as appropriate): This study requires 7 visits to the clinic and will take 8 weeks to complete.

If the study involves genetic research and/or storing data or specimens in a repository for future research, state that here.  Indicate whether subjects can opt out of these activities and still participate in the study.

Suggested wording for genetic research (use all that apply, modify as appropriate):

The purpose of the study is to understand the inheritance of (disorder).  If a gene or genes that cause (disorder) can be found, the diagnosis and treatment of (disorder) may be improved. 

Genes are the units of DNA--the chemical structure carrying your genetic information--that determine many human characteristics such as the color of your eyes, your height, and whether you are male or female.

The blood/tissue samples provided by you will be analyzed in the laboratory to determine whether there are differences in the genes of people with and without (disorder). 

Suggested wording for repositories (modify as appropriate):

We are asking you to provide [blood/tissue/information] for a [blood/tissue/data] bank, also called a repository.  These samples will be stored indefinitely and may be used and disclosed in the future for research, which may include genetic research.

Indicate how many subjects will be enrolled into the experiment both at OHSU and, where applicable, for the entire study.

For studies conducted at the PVAMC as well, state:
This study will be conducted at both the PVAMC and OHSU. The study procedures that will occur at PVAMC will be discussed in detail in the VA Consent Form.

PROCEDURES:  
Describe succinctly and in chronological order the procedures for this study.  It is not necessary to describe in detail procedures that are routine care and not required by the protocol. However, procedures that are required by the protocol must be included, even if they would occur if the subject did not participate in the research.  If appropriate, indicate which procedures would be done regardless of whether the subject participates in the study.

Clearly indicate which, if any, procedures are optional and state that subjects will be able to indicate their choice at the end of the form.

If there will be a placebo arm in the study, please make this clear and explain what a placebo is.  Sample language (modify as appropriate):  A placebo is a [pill, solution, cream, liquid] that looks like the study drug but has no real medicine in it.  

Indicate how subjects are assigned to different treatments or conditions.  Sample language (modify as appropriate):  This is a randomized study.  Neither you nor the investigator can choose whether you get the [study drug] or the placebo.  [insert proportion such as one-third] of subjects in this study will get the placebo. 

Indicate whether subjects or investigators will know what treatment subjects are receiving single/double-blind.  Sample language (modify as appropriate):  You and the investigators will not know which pill [or dose] you are taking.  The study is done this way because knowing whether you are getting the study drug can change the results of the study.  If you start having serious side effects from the study drug, the investigators can find out what you are taking in order to help you.  Please ask the investigator if you have any questions at all about this kind of study. 

State how much time the visits and procedures will require.  If studies are complex, use a simple table showing what procedures will occur at each study visit.  In most cases, tables provided by the sponsor in the study protocol are too complex to be of help to most subjects.  Example:


Visit 1

If blood is to be drawn, indicate the amount in units that are familiar to subjects only (1 teaspoon, 2 tablespoons)

If radiation is part of the experimental (not standard of care) part of the study, Radiation Safety Committee review of your protocol is required.  For more information on the Radiation Safety Committee, visit the web at: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/integrity/ehrs/ or contact the Radiation Safety Officer (4-7795; francoj@ohsu.edu) for more information.  Please note that studies using DEXA scans for research purposes will be submitted to Radiation Safety for review. Describe procedures that include radiation and add the following language:

Women who can become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test before the [PET scan, x-ray] is performed.

If questionnaires, surveys, diaries, or other data collection materials are being used, mention what kinds of questions will be asked and how long the tasks will take to complete, and upload a copy of each to your eIRB application.

If the subject's medical records will be reviewed (from OHSU or requested from another facility), state this and describe the information to be collected. 

If this is a genetic study and information about subjects' relatives will be collected, state (modify as appropriate): You may be asked to give us health information about your relatives. Any information you give us will be kept confidential as described in this consent. We will not contact your relatives without their permission. We may discuss with you the possibility of including your relatives in the study in the future.

If this study includes a repository and data/samples may be shared with the funder and/or other researchers, state: In the future, your [blood/tissue/information] may be given to [researchers, the funder, list as appropriate] for other research studies.  [If applicable: These studies may include genetic research.]  The [samples and/or information] will be labeled as described in the CONFIDENTIALITY section.

If this study includes collection of identifiable photographs (including identifiable images and physical likenesses), videotapes, or audiotapes that will be presented in public, include the following paragraph. [NOTE: if these materials will be used for marketing purposes, contact the ORIO.  Additional requirements may apply.] During this study [you, your image, your physical likeness] will be photographed, videotaped, or audiotaped [specify which].  We will use the photographs, videotapes, or audiotapes for educational materials, research publications, or marketing purposes [specify which]. 

* Describe succinctly and in chronological order the recording procedures. Specify the duration of the recording sessions.

* If attempts to conceal the participant's identity will be made, explain how (black bar over eyes, voice disguised, etc).

* Inform participants whether they will be able to inspect the photographs/recordings before they are released.

State: If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this study now or in the future, contact [PI Name (503) 494-####] [or other members of the study team at (503) ###-####].  (The PI phone number must match the first page of this consent form.)   
 
SUBJECT ACCESS TO GENETIC INFORMATION: (include if this study involves genetics or if future research studies may involve genetics)

Note that no information may be disclosed to anyone other than the subject without the subject's permission, except as permitted by law.  Further, results may be disclosed to the subject or the subject's physician only if the laboratory generating the results is CLIA-approved.

If findings of any kind (e.g., results of genetic studies, clinically relevant information, or incidental findings) are to be disclosed to the subject, describe the disclosure procedures (e.g., who will make the disclosure and to whom; a referral to a genetic counselor or a referral for appropriate medical advice must be provided). 

The subjects must be informed as to whether or not they will be contacted if the results of the study are found to have clinical relevance in the future or for any other reason.  If the subjects are not informed that they will be re-contacted in the consent document, any attempt to re-contact the subject by the researcher must first be approved by the IRB.

If no disclosures are to be made, explain why.

Suggested wording (use all that apply):

The results of these studies will not be made available to you because the research is still in an early phase and the reliability of the results is unknown.

If we discover new information that is important for your health care, either in this study or the future, you will be asked whether you wish to receive the results.  You may be required to have the test repeated in a clinical laboratory.  Because genetic information is complex and sensitive, the results should be discussed with a genetic counselor or your primary care giver who can answer your questions or discuss your concerns.  You would be responsible for all costs associated with having the test repeated and visiting a doctor or genetic counselor to discuss the results.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS: 
Describe reasonably foreseeable risks, side effects, discomforts, and inconveniences.  List the risks in order of their importance.  For example, if the study involves a drug with life-threatening side effects, these should be listed first.  When listing other side effects, arrange risks from most to least likely.  Avoid listing very serious side effects between two mild side effects and vice versa. 

Indicate if a risk applies only to a part of the study that is optional.

For studies involving investigational drugs or devices, also state: You may have some side effects we do not expect because we are still learning about ______.

If some side effects will not have symptoms noticeable to the subject (like abnormal lab values, state:  You may not have symptoms for some of these side effects, but you will be monitored by the investigator to check for any changes throughout the study.

Indicate risk of inducing malignancy, if relevant.

Indicate futility risk, if appropriate.  One risk to taking part in this study is that the study drug or the dose you receive may not be effective in helping to treat your disease. This means you may spend time in the study and experience side effects taking a drug that may not provide you with any health-related benefits.

Use standard wording where applicable:

For blood draw:  We will draw blood from [location on the body].  You may feel some pain when your blood is drawn.  There is a small chance the needle will cause bleeding, a bruise, an infection, or fainting.

For MRI: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine is a powerful magnet.  There are no known risks from the magnet itself. However, if you have metal in your body, the magnet may cause the metal to move.  If you know of any metal in your body, tell the investigator because you may not be able to have an MRI. Review any dental treatments you have had with the investigator, since these may involve metal.  The most common discomfort of an MRI is the length of time you must lie still or flat while the scan is being performed. Some people with claustrophobia (fear of closed spaces) may find the MRI machine too confining.  Finally, the MRI scanner makes loud beeping or thumping noises, so you may be offered protective earplugs to wear during the scan.  

[If contrast agent is used, add:]The dye that is injected into your body has been used in many patients and is generally well tolerated.  Some people feel dizzy or queasy, get a headache or notice a cold feeling near the site where the dye is injected. There is also a chance of having an allergic reaction to the dye that very rarely can be serious and life-threatening. If you have kidney disease, there is a chance that the dye could cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a disease in which too much scar tissue forms, leading to serious damage to skin, muscle, and internal organs, and, in some cases, death. If you have kidney disease or think your kidneys may not be functioning properly, you should discuss this with the investigator before any dye is injected.

For x-rays and DEXA scans:  In this study, you will be exposed to radiation during the [name of the procedure].  While we cannot be sure any dose of radiation is entirely safe, the amount you will be exposed to in this study is not known to cause health problems. 

For CT scans and nuclear medicine procedures, including PET scans: In this study, you will be exposed to radiation during the [name of scan] scan.  Although the amount to which you will be exposed is higher than from a typical x-ray, the risk of harmful effects from a single exam is very small.

For fluoroscopy:  In this study you will be exposed to radiation during the fluoroscopy for [name of the procedure].  There is a small chance this will cause you to lose your hair.  There is a rare chance that your skin may turn red or be damaged.  If your skin damage is severe, you may need medical treatment. 

For radiocontrast agents:  The [x-ray, CT, etc.] you will have in this study requires the injection of a contrast agent into your bloodstream.  The contrast agent shows up white on the images and helps the radiologist interpret them.  The contrast agent is given through a small needle placed into a vein.  Most people do not experience side effects or complications; however, you may feel a warm sensation or nausea during the injection. Some people have an allergic reaction, including itching, hives, swelling of the eyes or lips, sneezing, and/or difficulty breathing.  Very rarely, serious complications occur, including shock, kidney failure, and cardiac arrest.

For indwelling catheter:  You will have a catheter (tube) in your vein for more than 24 hours.  You may get an infection where the tube is placed.  This would cause swelling, redness, and pain.  You may bleed or get a bruise.  There is a small chance your blood stream or heart valves might get a serious infection.  You may get a blood clot that could go to your lungs.  These problems are very rare.  If you have these problems, you will need medical care.  Your catheter will be in place for [state time].

For endoscopy:  During the endoscopy, the endoscope may make you gag.  It may make you feel queasy or give you a sore throat.  There is a small chance your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine may bleed.  You may get an infection.  You may feel drowsy after taking the drug that relaxes you before the endoscopy.  You should not drive a car or operate machinery for 24 hours afterward. Once in a great while, an endoscopy makes a hole in someone's esophagus or stomach.  This happens about 1 time in every 5,000 endoscopies.  If this happens to you, you may need to have surgery to repair the hole.    

For bone marrow biopsy: Before the bone marrow biopsy, we will numb an area of your skin (usually near your hip) with a shot.  The shot may cause a little pain.  There is a rare chance of an allergic reaction to the numbing medicine, which can be serious and life-threatening.  Some people have moderate to severe pain when the bone marrow cells are drawn out.  Your hip may hurt for about 3-6 days.  There is a small chance you will get a bruise or an infection where the needle will be inserted.  You may bleed or have a scar.  Your skin may itch.   

For skin biopsy: In this study, we will remove a small piece of skin from [location].  This is called a skin biopsy.  To do this we will give you a shot to numb the area.  The shot may cause a little pain.  Some people (fewer than 1 in 10,000) are allergic to the shot you will get to numb the area where the skin is taken.  Heavy bleeding from a skin biopsy is rare.  Skin biopsies cause infections about 10% of the time, which would require antibiotics.  A small scar will form at the biopsy site.  The scar is usually much smaller than the original biopsy.  

For protocols involving surgery or other procedures that are NOT investigational but typically require clinical consent:  You have been invited to be in this research study because you are scheduled to have [name procedure].  That procedure is not experimental and is not part of this study, and the risks will be discussed with you separately.

For pregnancy/risk to fetus (For Women):  If you are nursing an infant or you are pregnant now, you must not be in the study.  This study may involve risks to an embryo, fetus, or nursing infant that are currently unknown.  If you are sexually active and could become pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use birth control that works well or you must not have sex. The investigator will talk to you about the types of birth control that are acceptable.  You will have to do this the whole time you are in this study [and, if applicable, state length of time following the study].  If you become pregnant during the research study, please tell the investigator and your doctor immediately.

For pregnancy/risk to fetus (For Men): The drugs in this study may damage sperm or be present in seminal fluid. You should not father a child or donate sperm while you are in this study [and, if applicable, state length of time following the study]. If you are a sexually active male and could cause a pregnancy, you must be sure that your female partner(s) are using birth control that works well or you must not have sex. This study may involve risks to an embryo or fetus that are currently unknown.  The investigator will talk to you about the types of birth control that are acceptable.  If a sexual partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the investigator and ask your partner to tell her doctor immediately.

For studies that enroll identified HIV positive subjects: As an HIV positive person you can give the HIV virus to your sexual partner(s) even if your viral load is very low or non-detectable.  You must be sure that your sexual partner(s) knows your status.  If you use a condom or female condom during intercourse, you will help reduce the risk of giving your partner HIV.  Using a spermicide like nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of giving HIV to your partner.  The investigator will discuss with you ways to minimize this risk.

For potential drug interactions: Whenever a study involves the administration of medications that may interact with several other medications, the following language must be included (modify as appropriate):  There are several drugs (prescription and non-prescription) that may cause problems when taken with the study drug.  The investigator will carefully review all of the drugs you are taking before giving you the study drug.  If any other health care provider prescribes any new drug(s) for you while you are in this study, please tell the investigator before you take the new drug.  You could also have that provider talk to the investigator before prescribing the new drug.  Do not take any new over-the-counter drugs while you are in this study unless you first check with the investigator.

For studies involving interviews/questionnaires/QOL assessments that discuss sensitive issues that may cause emotional upset, such as grieving, and not just routine matters: The risk of emotional upset must be described, and subjects must be informed that they may refuse to answer questions that upset them.  Sample language (modify as appropriate):  Some of these questions may seem very personal or embarrassing.  They may upset you.  You may refuse to answer any of the questions that you do not wish to answer.  If the questions make you very upset, we will help you to find a counselor.  

For genetic or repository studies:  Describe risks that may result from storage of samples/information in a repository, future research studies, or genetic research.  Specifically consider and address the risks associated with breach of confidentiality or psychological trauma.  Breach of confidentiality could impact insurability, employability, family plans, and family relationships.  Psychological risks to consider include the impact of learning results if no effective therapy for the disorder exists or the risk of stigmatization.

For genetic studies or future research that may include genetics, state:
A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Be aware that this federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  GINA also does not protect you against discrimination if you have already been diagnosed with the genetic disease being tested.

Although we have made efforts to protect your identity, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  If the results of these studies of your genetic makeup were to be accidentally released, it might be possible that the information we will gather about you as part of this study could become available to an insurer or an employer, or a relative, or someone else outside the study. Even though there are certain genetic discrimination and confidentiality protections in both Oregon law and federal law, there is still a small chance that you could be harmed if a release occurred.

If genetic information will be released to subjects, state:  The results of this study could provide information about how likely it is that you or one of your children or other relatives will develop [disorder] in the future. This may be very upsetting because [there is no therapy for (disorder) or the results may show that (disorder) may be passed on to children, or any other reason].

BENEFITS:	
Unless direct benefits to the subject are assured, use the following language:  You may or may not personally benefit from being in this study.  However, by serving as a subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.

When the subject will not benefit, but is participating solely from altruistic motives, use the following language:  You will not benefit from being in this study.  However, by serving as a subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.

ALTERNATIVES: 
State: You may choose not to be in this study.  [Describe alternative non-research procedures or treatments available, if any, which might be advantageous to the subject.  Avoid stating or implying that there are no alternatives.  If applicable, indicate that subjects need not participate in the research study to receive (the same) treatment for their condition.]

CONFIDENTIALITY 
State:  We will take steps to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.  [If there are special precautions this study is taking to achieve this, describe here, e.g., collecting data anonymously or coding samples immediately so they are never identified.]

We will create and collect health information about you as described in the Purpose and Procedures sections of this form.  Health information is private and is protected under federal law and Oregon law.  By agreeing to be in this study, you are giving permission (also called authorization) for us to use and disclose your health information as described in this form.

The investigators, study staff, and others at OHSU may use the information we collect and create about you in order to conduct and oversee this research study [and store in a repository, conduct future research, as applicable; state if any of these are optional].

We may release this information to others outside of OHSU who are involved in conducting or overseeing research, including [list as applicable]:

* The funder of this study, [funder name], and the funder's representatives 
* The Food and Drug Administration
* The Office for Human Research Protections, a federal agency that oversees research involving humans
* [Specify others, such as NCI, NIH, coordinating centers, etc.]

Those listed above may also be permitted to review and copy your records, including your medical records.

We may also share your information with other researchers, who may use it for future research studies. [Only include if other researchers may receive PHI; state if this is optional.]

We will not release information about you to others not listed above, unless required or permitted by law.  We will not use your name or your identity for publication or publicity purposes, unless we have your special permission.

For studies involving interviews, questionnaires, surveys, or other procedures during which such information may be learned, state: Under Oregon law, suspected child or elder abuse must be reported to appropriate authorities.

If applicable, also state:  OHSU complies with Oregon state requirements for reporting certain diseases and conditions to local health departments.

State:  When we send specimens or information outside of OHSU, they may no longer be protected under federal or Oregon law.  In this case, your specimens or information could be used and re-released without your permission.

If applicable, indicate how information will be shared with other researchers (not industry sponsors) and whether shared materials will include identified information or genetic information.  Examples (modify based on your planned procedures for sample and data labeling):
[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  A code number will be assigned to you, your cells and genetic information, as well as to information about you.  Only the investigators and people involved in the conduct of the study will be authorized to link the code number to you.  Other investigators who may receive samples of your [blood/tissue/genetic information/medical information] for research will be given only the code number which will not identify you. 

       or

[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  All identifying information about you will be removed from the samples before they are released to any other investigators. 

       or

[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  Your samples will be labeled with [your name or other information (specify)] that will identify you.  Other investigators who may receive samples of your [blood/tissue/genetic information/medical information] for research will also be given information that may identify you or your family members.  

State:  We may continue to use and disclose your information as described above indefinitely. [Specify alternate end date or event if applicable.]

Some of the information collected and created in this study may be placed in your OHSU medical record.  While the research is in progress, you may or may not have access to this information.  After the study is complete, you will be able to access any study information that was added to your OHSU medical record.  If you have questions about what study information you will be able to access, and when, ask the investigator.

Additional Protections for Special Types of Information [Delete this entire section if not applicable.]
