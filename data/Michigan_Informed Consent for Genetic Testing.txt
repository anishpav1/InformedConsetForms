Informed Consent for
Genetic Testing
Patient Education Information for Use with the Michigan
Model Consent Form for Genetic Testing

Many new advances are occurring in medicine, especially
in the field of medical genetics. This booklet was prepared by
the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in
compliance with Michigan law to help answer your questions
about genetic testing. Our goal is to make sure you are well
informed before you decide to give a sample for testing.
The booklet includes a glossary to help you understand
genetics-related terms. The booklet also includes a model
consent form that contains the minimum information an
individual undergoing a genetic test must understand as required
by Michigan law. It was developed to help you and your health
care provider discuss information that you should understand
before consenting to a genetic test. Your health care provider
is responsible for ensuring that the consent form that you sign
complies with Michigan law.
Genetic testing is voluntary. Only you can decide if you
want to be tested. Each person’s situation is unique. You may
want more information before you decide what to do. People
often have questions about the condition for which testing is
being considered. They may also have questions about other
issues such as insurance coverage. Your health care provider will
explain the purpose of the test and try to answer your questions.
If you still have unanswered questions, be sure to ask your
physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or
genetic counselor before you agree to have the genetic test being
offered to you.

1.	 What is a genetic test?
There are many different types of genetic tests. A genetic
test is any analysis used to look at a person’s genetic makeup.
Everyone is born with
a unique set of genes.
Sometimes a person’s
genes may cause a disease
or birth defect. Genes can
also cause certain physical
features, or an increased
chance of developing a
certain condition.
Depending on the type of genetic test ordered, the test may
detect a single genetic condition or multiple genetic conditions.
Your health care provider should inform you about the
condition(s) for which you are being offered testing as part of the
genetic counseling that occurs before genetic testing.
A genetic test is considered a predictive test if a result
indicates a person has an increased chance of developing a disease
or condition in the future, but developing the disease is not a
certainty. A genetic test is considered a presymptomatic test
if a result indicates a person will eventually develop a disease or
condition. A genetic test is considered a diagnostic test if a
result confirms a suspected diagnosis.
Genetic tests are usually performed using a blood sample,
specifically white blood cells. Tissue or cheek cell samples also
may be used. When testing a pregnancy, chorionic villus,
amniotic fluid, or a sample of the mother’s blood (which
includes a small amount of the baby’s genetic information) can
be used. The test may examine a person’s DNA, RNA, proteins,
or other chemicals in cells that can indicate a genetic condition.
2.	 What is the purpose of genetic testing?
There are different reasons for doing genetic tests. A genetic
test can be done to:
●	

2

Confirm a diagnosis that is already suspected based on
personal and family medical history and/or a medical exam.

●	

Determine the chance a healthy person is at risk or will
develop a disease or condition in the future.
●	Determine carrier status. A carrier has a change in a specific
gene or genes that increases his or her chance of having a
child with a genetic disease or birth defect.
3.	 What are the limitations of genetic testing?
There is no one test that detects all genetic diseases. Genetic
testing is highly accurate, but there are some limitations, including
the following:
n	 Performing the correct test:
Your health care provider must have accurate information
about your personal medical history and family history to determine
which genetic test(s) to perform and correctly interpret the results.
If you are being tested for a disease that runs in your family, but the
test used is not for the condition your relative(s) actually had, your
own result will not give accurate information about whether you
have or are at risk for the condition. Tests that depend on having
samples from relatives may be interpreted incorrectly if there is
non-paternity (named father is not the biological father of a child)
or if the true bloodlines in a family are not known.
n	 Laboratory processing:
All certified laboratories have strict rules for handling samples
from the time the sample is received to the reporting of the
results. In rare cases, problems may occur in handling the sample,
which might lead to incorrect results.
n	 Implications of results:
The significance of a genetic change for your health/your
family’s health may not be known at the time of testing. A genetic
test result may reveal a change in a gene associated with having or
being at risk for a genetic condition. However, there can be limits
to the information provided when a gene change is found, such as:
●	

A gene change that confirms a suspected diagnosis
(diagnostic testing) may not give information about how
severe the condition will be.
3

●	

A gene change that indicates an increased risk for developing
a condition in the future (predictive testing) cannot predict
with certainty whether a person will actually develop the
condition, or when symptoms will appear.

●	

A gene change that shows a healthy person will eventually
develop a condition (presymptomatic testing) does not tell
exactly when the condition will occur.

It is important that you discuss your genetic test results with
your health care provider so that you are fully informed about
what the results mean for you and your family.
4.	 What are the benefits and risks of genetic testing?
n	Benefits:
There are several possible benefits of genetic testing. For example:
●	

Finding an increased risk of disease might lead a person to
choose preventive or therapeutic medical treatments that
reduce the chance of developing the disease.

●	

Having knowledge can empower a person and family
members to make important life planning decisions, even if a
cure is not available at that time.

●	

Having a specific diagnosis could qualify a person to enroll in
research studies, which may lead to new treatments.

●	

Knowing about a certain gene might provide important
health information for a person’s family.

n	Risks:
There are also several possible risks of genetic testing. For
example,
●	

4

The physical risk of testing is
usually minimal, typically not more
than providing a blood sample.
If your test involves any other
type of sample, the physician
performing the procedure, or a
designated representative, should
explain the risks before you decide
to have the test.

●	

Potential psychological and social risks of testing are related
to how the results might change a person’s life. The decision
to have genetic testing can be stressful. You may have
emotional reactions to learning that you do or do not carry
a gene change for a certain condition. For these reasons,
meeting with a therapist may be suggested before some
genetic tests are performed.

●	

Additional psychological and social risks include the impact
of testing on family relationships. A person who decides to
have genetic testing needs to consider whether to tell other
family members. Sometimes the result for one family member
can disclose information about the genetic makeup of other
relatives, even if they have not been tested. Furthermore, a
genetic test may reveal unexpected relationships, such as nonpaternity (a different biological father).

●	

There are possible economic risks of genetic testing that may
affect a person’s ability to obtain health, life, disability or longterm care insurance. It could also affect the ability to obtain
or keep a job.

●	

Genetic test results are part of your medical record. If a
genetic test is performed, your insurance company may have
access to the result.

●	

There are both state and federal laws to help protect a
person. The laws prevent the use of genetic information by
health insurers and employers. Please visit https://migrc.org/
PublicHealth/PolicyandLaw.html for direct links to help you
find further information about such laws.

5.	 What do the results of genetic testing mean?
Genetic tests are often a valuable tool, but sometimes do not
provide a definite answer. Most often, results can be classified as
negative or positive.
n	 Negative or “normal”:
A negative or normal result means you do not have a change
in the gene(s) tested. Usually a negative test result is good news,
but there are some limitations. Some clinical conditions can be
caused by more than one gene and the laboratory may not have
5

tested for all of these genes. Other conditions may be caused
by different types of changes within the same gene, but the
laboratory may not test for all of the types of changes. This
means a negative test does not always rule out the presence of
every gene change that could cause a disease. You still might have
a change in a gene, even if your test is normal.
The technology to identify new genes associated with a genetic
condition or to detect certain types of genetic changes improves
every year. If your test result is negative, you may want to ask
whether a better test is likely to become available and then check
back with your health care provider periodically in the future.
n	 Positive or “abnormal”:
A positive or “abnormal” test result means you carry a gene
change that is known to cause a specific condition, or can put you
at increased risk of developing a genetic condition. Not all gene
changes lead to symptoms.
A positive result on a carrier test means that you have an
increased chance of having a child with a specific genetic condition.
In most cases, being a carrier does not increase your chance of
having any health concerns but there are some exceptions.
A positive test result also indicates that you have an increased
chance of having a child with the same genetic condition. How
small or big that chance is depends on how the condition is
inherited in the family. If you have children or are considering
having children, it is important to talk to your health care
provider about what your test results mean for them.

6

n	Inconclusive:
Sometimes a test result falls in between the normal and
abnormal range. In such cases, a genetic change, called a variant
(sometimes referred to as ‘variants of uncertain significance’),
may be identified but the laboratory does not have enough
information to determine whether or not the change is associated
with a genetic condition/risk. Laboratories may learn more about
a variant in the future and this may allow the lab to eventually
classify the variant as a normal (negative) or abnormal (positive)
test result. For this reason, if your testing reveals a variant, it is
important to contact your health care provider periodically to see
if any more information is available.

a copy of the form and booklet for my records.

8. My questions have been answered to my satisfaction.

7. I have been informed who may have access to my genetic test result, which is part of my confidential medical record.

6. I have been informed who may have access to my biological sample, and that any leftover sample may be retained by
the laboratory.

5. I have been informed that genetic testing can sometimes reveal secondary findings- results that are not related to the
purpose of testing. I have discussed with my health care professional if and/or how such results will be shared with
me. I understand that it is up to me to decide whether I want secondary results reported back to me and what secondary
results I want reported.

n	 Secondary Findings:
Sometimes genetic testing reveals a finding that is unrelated
to the reason for doing the test. These are called secondary
findings or incidental findings. Examples of secondary findings
include:
●	

Non-paternity. Finding out the person designated as the
father is not the biological father of the person having testing.

●	

Consanguinity. Finding out the biological parents are closelyrelated by blood.

●	

Other unexpected findings, such as identifying a genetic
risk unrelated to the condition for which testing was being
performed. Some tests look for genetic changes across a
person’s genetic makeup, rather than just looking at specific
genes known to be related to the person’s symptoms/
family history. When this type of testing is done, there is a
possibility that it might reveal a risk for a genetic condition
that is unrelated to the original reason for testing.

Genetic testing laboratories have different ways of reporting
these types of secondary findings to patients and providers. How
they are reported depends on a number of factors including
laboratory policies, whether knowing the result will change a
person’s medical care, and your preferences. It is important for
your health care provider to discuss how you want any potential
secondary findings handled during your pre-test genetic counseling.
Overall, before you proceed with genetic testing, make
sure you understand what a negative, positive, or inconclusive
test result will mean by discussing your situation with your
physician, nurse, nurse
practitioner, physician
assistant or genetic
counselor. Also, speak
to your health care
professional about
the possibility of
secondary results
and how they will be
handled.

6.	 What will happen to my sample after the genetic
test is completed?
You have the right to know what will happen to any
remaining sample. As part of the informed consent, your health
care provider should discuss this with you before genetic testing.
The consent may allow you to say whether you are willing to have
your sample used for other purposes, such as research.
7.	 Who has access to my sample and information from
the test?
Genetic tests are handled in a confidential manner, like other
personal health information. The person collecting your sample,
and people in the laboratory performing the test, will handle your
sample. The health care provider who ordered the test will receive
the results. Your medical record and test results are confidential.
Your written permission is required before your medical record is
released to anyone else.
Genetic information is familial information. Sometimes your
test results can provide your family members with important
information about their genetic risks. Therefore, it is important
for you to be willing to share your results with your family,
especially if the condition you are being tested for is preventable.
You should discuss with your health care provider ways that you
can share your information with your family.

8

8.	 What is the cost of
genetic testing?
The cost depends
on the test performed.
Typically the cost can range
from a few hundred to
several thousand dollars.
Before having testing, ask
about the cost of the test
and whether it is covered
by insurance. Find out if
you will be responsible
for any or all of the test
bill. Genetic tests are not
always covered by medical
insurance, and you may
need to pay some or all
of the cost. Also consider
whether you have a
deductible for your health
insurance and whether you
have met the deductible for the year.
9.	 Where can I get more information about genetic
testing and related services in Michigan?
You can ask your physician, genetic counselor, or other health
care provider. You can also call the Michigan Department of
Health and Human Services toll-free at 1-866-852-1247 or visit

GLOSSARY OF GENETIC TERMS
Amniotic fluid:
The fluid surrounding an unborn fetus; it contains fetal
cells that can be used for genetic testing.
Birth defect:
An abnormal condition that occurs before or at birth.
Birth defects can cause physical and developmental
problems that may require special medical care or
therapy.
Carrier status:
The knowledge of whether a healthy person has a
disease-causing gene change (mutation) that could be
passed down to his or her children. Carrier status is
often determined by genetic screening.
Cell:
A small membrane-bound compartment, filled with
chemicals; the subunit of all living things, including
humans.
Chorionic villus:
Cells contained in the tissue of the placenta in early
pregnancy. The tissue contains the same genetic
information as the developing fetus.
Diagnostic testing:
A test to confirm the presence or absence of a specific
disease or condition.

process involves: assessing a person’s chance of a
genetic condition based on family history, medical
history information and genetic test results; providing
education about the genetic condition(s) for which they
are at risk and what it could mean to the family; helping
the patient and family make informed choices about the
use of genetic information based on the family’s values
