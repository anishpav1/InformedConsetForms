Appendix - Appendectomy (Laparoscopic) (Appendectomy
(Laparoscopic))
The Procedure
I request John Smith to do the following procedure: Appendix - Appendectomy (Laparoscopic)
(Appendectomy (Laparoscopic))
At this site/location: See description of treatment/procedure.

Communication with my Doctor
John Smith has explained the following information:
 Operation/procedure :
This procedure involves removing the appendix. Your surgeon will make several small
incisions in the skin on the abdomen. They will usually be over the appendix.
Laparoscopic surgery is done using a scope and hollow tube(s) called ports. These
are inserted through small cuts in the abdomen. A scope is a thin, lighted instrument
with a camera attached. It lets the surgeon see inside the abdomen. The surgeon can
pass tools through the ports. Carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the abdomen. This
helps the surgeon see inside the abdomen. It also gives more room to work. Your
surgeon may not be able to complete the procedure using a scope. If the surgery is
not done with a scope, it may be done through a larger cut.
Your surgeon will check nearby structures. The attachments of the appendix to the
bowel and the abdomen will be carefully cut and sealed. The appendix will be
removed.
Your surgeon will close the cut with stitches, staples, strips of tape, or other ways. A
temporary drain may be placed. This will allow fluid to drain from the inside to the
outside of the abdomen.



Illness or medical condition :
Appendicitis. This is inflammation and infection of the appendix. The appendix is a
tube-like structure attached to the large intestine near where it joins with the small
intestine. Appendicitis results in pain and infection in the abdomen.



Treatment options :
* Antibiotic medicines to treat the infection.
* Removing the appendix through one larger incision (open procedure).
* You may choose not to have this procedure.



Prognosis and possible risks if I do not have the operation/procedure:

If you choose not to have this procedure, your appendix may rupture. Infection may
spread. A ruptured appendix may cause death.



Risks of the operation/procedure:
* Another source of your problem may be found during the procedure.
* Pain, numbness, swelling, weakness or scarring where tissue is cut.
* Scar(s). Scars may be painful. They may limit function or range of motion. They
also may not look the way you want them to.
* The gas used in laparoscopic procedures to inflate the abdomen can become
trapped in tissues. Gas in the bloodstream can dangerously affect blood flow and
heart function.
* The procedure may not cure or relieve your condition or symptoms. They may come
back and even worsen.
* You may need additional tests or treatment.
* Your doctor may not be able to complete the procedure using a scope or robotics.
Your doctor may have to make a bigger cut to do the procedure.
* Bleeding. You may need blood transfusions or other treatments. This may be
discovered during the procedure, or later.
* Chest pain. Chest pressure.
* Embolism. An embolism is an object that moves through your body in your
bloodstream. It can be an air bubble, a blood clot, a piece of fat or other material. It
can block a blood vessel. This can lead to stroke, pulmonary embolism (blockage of
the main artery of the lung), or injury to organs or extremities.
* Infection.
* Rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* Bladder problems after surgery. You may need a tube to drain urine. You may need
other procedures.
* Breathing problems. You may need a breathing tube or other treatment.
* Damage to the bladder or nearby structures. This may be discovered during the
procedure, or later. You may need a catheter or surgery.
* Urinary tract problems after procedure. This can include difficulty holding urine,
frequent urination, bleeding and pain. These may be temporary or permanent.
* Wound infection, poor healing or reopening. Blood or clear fluid can also collect at
the wound site(s).
* An abscess or build-up of pus may form. It may require drainage or additional
surgery.
* Bowel obstruction (blockage).
* Damage to the bowel or nearby structures, possibly requiring an ostomy. An ostomy
is an opening in the abdominal wall. It allows stool to drain into a bag. This damage
may be discovered during the procedure, or later.
* Damage to the intestines or nearby structures. This may be discovered during the
procedure, or later.
* Fistula. An abnormal connection between channels in your body. This can include
the rectum, bladder, urethra, prostate (in men) or vagina (in women).
* Incisional hernia. Weak scar tissue may allow tissue to bulge through the cut.
* Leak of bowel contents at the procedure site.
* The instrument(s) placed in your abdomen can cause injuries to nearby structures.
The equipment used to control bleeding can cause burning injuries.
* Damage, blockage, or sudden closure of blood vessels which may become an
emergency.
* Death.

symptoms in the abdomen.



Expectations – how to prepare for my operation:
Before your operation:
* If you have had anything to eat or drink close to the time of your surgery, please
notify your doctor.
* General anesthesia is usually given during this procedure. You should not drive or
make critical decisions for 24 hours after the procedure. You will need someone to

adult available to help you the rest of the day.



Expectations – recovery – including information on medication, nutrition, pain control,
return to activity and wound care:

* Do not lift anything over 15 pounds. Do not do strenuous physical activity until your
doctor allows, including lifting or straining.
* You can return to work or school when you feel well enough and are no longer
needing strong prescription pain medicines. Most patients can return to school or
work in three to seven days as long as no lifting or straining is involved.
Diet:
* Eat high-fiber foods to avoid straining during bowel movements. If you are on pain
medicine, your doctor may prescribe a stool softener to aid this process as well.

* Your wound will be covered with a bandage, surgical glue, or a sterile dressing.
Leave the wound covered for 48 hours. Change the dressing if it gets wet.
* Do not soak in a bathtub until your wound cover is removed. Taking a shower is OK.
Avoid getting the bandage, or your wound, wet.
* If your wound is closed with strips of tape, leave them in place until they fall off.
* A small amount of drainage is normal. If the drainage is red, has a bad odor, or
covers your entire dressing, call your surgeon.
Follow-up care:
* Call your surgeon to schedule your follow-up visit.
* You will recover faster if you get up and start walking within hours after your
operation.
* Observe your wound for any signs of infection.
* Take medication for pain as needed.
* Do not drive, operate machinery, or make any important business or legal decisions if
