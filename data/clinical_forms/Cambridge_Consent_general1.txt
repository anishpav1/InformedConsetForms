And I authorize the dentist to remove the following teeth:

and any others necessary for reasons in

paragraph #3. I understand removing teeth does not always remove all the infection, ifpresent, and it may be necessary to have
further treatment. 1 understand the risks involved in having teeth removed, some of which are pain, swelling, spread ofinfection, dry
socket, Joss of feeling in my teeth, lips tongue and surrounding tissue (Paresthesia) that can last for an indefinite period oftime or

CROWNS, BRIDGES, AND CAPS: I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color ofnatural teeth exactly with
artificial teeth. I further understand that 1 may be wearing temporary crowns, which may come off easily and that I must be careful to
ensure that tl1ey are kept on until the permanent crowns are delivered. I realize the final opportunity to make changes in my news
crown bridge, or cap (including shape, fit, and color) will be before cementation. It is also my responsibility to return for permanent
cementation within 21 days from tooth preparation. Excessive delays may allow for tooth movement. This may necessitate a remake
oftl1e crown, bridge, or cap. I understand that there will be additional charges for remakes due to my delaying permanent
cementation.

ENDODONTIC TREATMENT (ROOT CANAL): I realize there is no guarantee tliat root canal therapy will save my tooth, and
that complications can occur from tl1e treatment, and that occasionally root canal filling material may extend tlrrough t11e toot11 which
does not necessarily effect tl1e success of the treatment. I understand that endodontic files are very fine instruments and stresses from
their manufacture can cause them to separate during use. I understand tliat occasionally additional surgical procedures may be
necessary following root canal treatment (apicoectomy). I understand that the tooth may be lost in spite of all efforts to save it.

periodontal condition.

DENTURES: I understand tl1e wearing ofdentures is difficult. Sore spots, altered speech, and difficulty in eating are some common
problems. Immediate dentures (placement ofdenture in1111ediately after extractions) may be painful. Immediate dentures may require
considerable adjusting and several relines. A permanent reline will be needed later. This is not included in the denture fee. I
understand that it is my responsibility to return for delivery ofthe dentures. I understand that failure to keep my delivery appointment
may result in poorly fitted dentures. Ifa remake is required due to my delays of 30 days, tl1ere will be additional charges.
