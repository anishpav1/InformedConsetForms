MEDICAL IMMOBILIZATION (PAPOOSE) CONSENT
When employing oral sedation or in emergency situations in pediatric dentistry, it becomes necessary to control
excessive head, arm and leg movement in order to provide safe, comfortable and quality dental treatment. Almost
always, these patients are very young, extremely fearful and/or moderately to severely disabled.
The most compassionate technique we have found for immobilizing these special patients involves the use of the
Papoose Board (also known as a “sleeping bag” or “protective blanket”) and one or more safety belts. We believe
that this approach is much less traumatic than restraining your child using several adults. An example of a young
child in a Papoose Board is shown in the diagram below:

Please feel free to ask any questions you may have regarding the preceding information. In addition, you may wish
to discuss our recommendations with other individuals who are involved in caring for your child. State Law requires
us to obtain your permission before we may use the Papoose Board to assist in providing safe, high quality dental
care for your child.
I hereby give my consent to Dr. Elizabeth Crespi to use the Papoose Board and it’s accessories as an essential part
of their efforts to render mutually agreed upon dental services for my child. I am aware that Dr. Elizabeth Crespi is a
specialist in pediatric dentistry. I further agree that this consent shall remain in full force unless withdrawn in writing
by the person who has signed below on behalf of the minor patient.
Thank you for taking the time to read and sign this document.
