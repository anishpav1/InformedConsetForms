Gallbladder - Cholecystectomy with Common Duct Exploration
(Laparoscopic) (Cholecystectomy with Possible Common Duct
Exploration (Laparoscopic))

 

The Procedure

| request John Smith to do the following procedure: Gallbladder - Cholecystectomy with
Common Duct Exploration (Laparoscopic) (Cholecystectomy with Possible Common Duct
Exploration (Laparoscopic))

Communication with my Doctor

John Smith has eXoIained the following information:
o Operation/procedure :

This procedure involves removing the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small organ
that stores bile which helps with digestion. It is not necessary for digestive function.

The surgery may be done laparoscopically. Laparoscopic surgery is done using a
scope and hollow tube(s) called ports. These are inserted through small cuts in the
abdomen. A scope is a thin, lighted instrument with a camera attached. It lets the
surgeon see inside the abdomen. The surgeon can pass tools through the ports.
Carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the abdomen. This helps the surgeon see inside
the abdomen. It also gives more room to work. Your surgeon may not be able to
complete the procedure using a scope. Ifthe surgery is not done with a scope, it may
be done through a larger out.

Your surgeon will free the gall bladder from the liver, bile duct, and surrounding
arteries. The bile ducts may be explored with the use of a flexible scope during this
surgery. Your surgeon may take an x-ray ofthe bile ducts during the procedure.
Contrast dye is injected into the ducts. The dye lets your surgeon see any stones that
may be blocking the bile ducts. If stones are found, more surgery may be done to
remove them.

Your surgeon will remove the gallbladder. A drain may be inserted to keep fluid from
building up in the treatment area. Your surgeon will close the cut with stitches,
staples, or other methods. Your surgeon will remove the drain some time afterthe

surgery

(Laparoscopic) (Cholecystectomy with Possible Common Duct
Exploration (Laparoscopic))

 

Pain, gallstones, disease, inflammation, or other problems with the gallbladder.

0 Treatment o.tions :

* Watching and waiting with your doctor.

* Removing the gallbladderthrough one large incision made in the abdomen.

* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This uses an endoscope
and real-time x-ray to view the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, and other nearby
structures.

*Placement of a cholecystostomy tube.

* You may choose not to have any treatment at all.

0 and possible risks ifl do not have the operation/procedure:
If you choose not to have this procedure, pain, infection, inflammation, and/or stones
may continue or get worse.

0 of the operation/procedure:

* Exposure to radiation. Pregnant women and women of childbearing age should talk
with their doctor about this.

* Pain, numbness, swelling, weakness or scarring where tissue is cut.

* The gas used in laparoscopic procedures to inflate the abdomen can become
trapped in tissues. Gas in the bloodstream can dangerously affect blood flow and
heart function.

* The procedure may not cure or relieve your condition or symptoms. They may come
back and even worsen.

* You may need additional tests or treatment.

* Your doctor may not be able to complete the procedure using a scope or robotics.
Your doctor may have to make a bigger cut to do the procedure.

discovered during the procedure, or later.

* Embolism. An embolism is an object that moves through your body in your
bloodstream. It can be an air bubble, a blood clot, a piece of fat or other material. It
can block a blood vessel. This can lead to stroke, pulmonary embolism (blockage of
the main artery ofthe lung), or injury to organs or extremities.

* Reactions to dye used for imaging. These may include hives, swelling ofthe face
and/orthroat, difficulty breathing, and kidney failure.

* Retained stones in bile ducts.

* The device, equipment, or material used to do the procedure or implanted may not
work correctly, fail or cause problems during the procedure or later. The procedure
may not be completed. You may need additional treatment now or later.

* Wound infection, poor healing or reopening. Blood or clear fluid can also collect at
the wound site(s).

* Damage to the bile ducts or nearby structures. This may be discovered during the
procedure, or later.

* Incisional hernia. Weak scartissue may allow tissue to bulge through the cut.

* The instrument(s) placed in your abdomen can cause injuries to nearby structures.
The equipment used to control bleeding can cause burning injuries.

* Death.

In addition to the risks listed above, any health or disease factors that |/my child has that
could increase my risks has been explained.
