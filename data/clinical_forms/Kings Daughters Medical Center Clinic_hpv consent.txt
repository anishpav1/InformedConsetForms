HPV VACCINATION CONSENT FORM
King’s Daughters Medical Center Clinic
Genital human papillomavirus (“HPV”) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the
United States. Most HPV infections don’t cause any symptoms, and go away on their own;
however, HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. HPV is also associated with several less
common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women, and anal and oropharyngeal
(back of the throat, including base of tongue and tonsils) cancers in both men and women. HPV
can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. The HPV vaccine can prevent most cases of
cervical cancer in females, if it is given before exposure to the virus. In addition, it can prevent
vaginal and vulvar cancer in females, and genital warts and anal cancer in both males and
females. The HPV vaccine is offered in three (3) doses (each dose injected by shot). The second
and thirst doses are administered two (2) and six (6) months, respectively, after the first dose.
King’s Daughters Medical Center (“KDMC”, “we” or “us”) will offer HPV vaccinations at
Carter County during the course of the 2016/2017 school year. In order to receive the HPV
vaccine, Student must have this HPV Vaccination Consent Form in addition to a separate
Consent for Services form on file at school, both completed and signed by Student’s parent or
legal guardian.
Please sign below as Parent/Guardian if you give permission to KDMC to administer the HPV
vaccine to Student.
