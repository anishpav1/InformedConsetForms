INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT
FOR PERIODONTAL THERAPY
Please read the following information carefully. Risks associated with your periodontal therapy
are explained below. Please take the time you need to ask all your questions before you sign.
Periodontal therapy can be required for a variety of reasons. These reasons include the
persistence of periodontal pockets that make proper cleaning of the teeth and gums impossible,
the presence of infect ion and the loss of bone support to the teeth. Periodontal therapy is
performed to reduce or eliminate these pockets, remove unhealthy tissue and to thoroughly clean
the root surfaces of the teeth. However, due to many factors such as advanced state of disease,
lacke of adequate home care, nutritional or hormonal factors, etc., your problem may persist or
even worsen with time and teth could be lost in the future.
It is important that you are aware that the success of your periodontal therapy is largely
dependent on you. You must follow the instructions for home care very closely to get a good
result. You should expect increased sensitivity of the tooth roots t o cold, heat or sweets. This
normally decreases over time, but the intensity and duration of discomfort vary greatly from
person to person. Please be assured that we will use the utmost care in performing this procedure
and have every reason to expect success.
I have read the above and have discussed with the Doctor the risks and treatment options of
periodontal therapy. I understand that dentistry is not an exact science and no guarantee can be
made to me. I hereby give my permission to proceed with the periodontal therapy.
