Intravenous Contrast Media Questionnaire

Your doctor has ordered a MRI Examinati on, which requires you to have contrast material (dye) injected
into your veins. During the injection some people feel a cool sensation that lasts a few minutes and then
goes away. Reactions to MRI contrast are extremely rare. The following reactions are not seen in
everyone, but one or more of them may occur:
•
Nausea, sometimes with vomiting;
•
Sneezing
•
Itching and hives
•
Swelling of the lips and I or around the eyes.
A more moderate reaction to contrast may be that you develop itching or hives several days after the test
even though you did not have this reaction on the day of the test. Very rarely, more severe types of
reactions occur. These include, but are not limited to: difficulty breathing, shock, kidney failure, cardiac
arrest and death. A condition called NSF(Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis) has been reported, but only in
patients with severe pre-existing renal disease.
Although it doesn't happen very often, there is a chance that some of the contrast may leak from your vein
into the area around the needle, which might result in tenderness and swelling at the injection site. If you
feel any pain during the injection of contrast, please tell the technologist or the nurse.
If any of these reactions occur after you leave, please call the doctor who ordered the MRI. If the
symptoms become worse, or if you develop any difficulty breathing or swelling of the tongue or lips ---Go
to the nearest Emergency Room for evaluation and treatment
