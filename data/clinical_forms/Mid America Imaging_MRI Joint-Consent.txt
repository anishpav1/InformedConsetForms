As part of your exam, the MRI Radiologist may find it advisable to give you an intravenous injection of a contrast agent (dye). This
injection may help the physician more accurately diagnose your condition. Although MRI contrast agents have been used safely in
millions of cases, minor reactions (principally headache or nausea) occur in about 2% of patients; whereas serious or life threatening
reactions have been reported in about one in 400,000 patients.
All questions about the MRI exam are welcomed and no questions are considered unimportant. The MRI exam will be supervised and
interpreted by a Board Certified Radiologist associated with Radiology Consultants of Mid-America,PC.
The MRI exam procedure has been explained to me fully. I acknowledge that medicine is not an exact science and I understand that
the examination involves some element of risk despite precautions, and that there is a possibility of complications, either directly or
indirectly, which may result. Possible common risks as well as the benefits associated with the MRI exam have been explained to me.
I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE
CONTENTS OF THIS FORM, AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INFORMATION ON THIS FORM, AND
REGARDING THE MRI PROCEDURE THAT I AM ABOUT TO UNDERGO.
