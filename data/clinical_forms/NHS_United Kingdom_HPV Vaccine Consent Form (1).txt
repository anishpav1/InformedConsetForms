Vaccination consent form
The HPV vaccine, that protects against cervical cancer, is being offered to your daughter at her school.
The leaﬂet that accompanies this form tells you and your daughter about the HPV vaccine. To get the
best protection, it is important that she receives all three injections over the next six months. Please
discuss this with your daughter, then complete this form and return it to the school before the vaccination
is due to be given. Information about the vaccinations will be put on your daughter’s health records,
including records at her GP’s surgery and held by the NHS. If you have more questions, please contact
the school nurse or other health professional or go to www.immunisation.nhs.uk/hpv for further
