Consent for Anesthesia Services
The following is provided to inform patients and parents about having treatment under anesthesia. The information is not
presented to make you more apprehensive, but rather to enable you to better understand the risks and benefits involved
with anesthetic treatment.
I hereby authorize and request any doctor represented with CarePoint to administer anesthesia as previously discussed
with me. I understand and agree that procedures not talked about, but deemed necessary for my child’s well-being, may
be performed to supplement the planned anesthesia. It has been explained to me that all types of anesthesia, although
safe, involve some risks and no guarantees can be made concerning results. Serious complications are very rare. The
following are complications that may be associated with the anesthetic treatment:
Common complications:
Uncommon complications:
 Pain and/or bruising at the IV site
 Headache
 Sore throat and/or hoarseness
 Injuries to lips or teeth from airway
instruments or devices
 Muscle aches
 Unexpected drug reaction
 Nausea and/or vomiting
 Infection at intravenous site and veins nearby
Rare complications:
 Bleeding/injury in the nose due to passage of a
 Heart injury
breathing tube
 Brain damage or death
 Lung infection
 Eye injury or infection
 Weakness in breathing after awakening
 Nerve damage
Alternative options to deep sedation/general anesthesia have been discussed with me and may include the use of local
anesthesia with nitrous oxide sedation or local anesthesia alone.
I confirm that the patient has not had anything to eat or drink (other than indicated medications with the smallest
amount of water) for at least eight (8) hours prior to anesthesia.
I certify that to my knowledge the patient is not pregnant or trying to become pregnant.
I have read and agree to the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices posted on our website, www.carepointanesthesia.com.
I consent to the anesthesia deemed appropriate by my anesthesiologist. I acknowledge that I have read this form or had it
read to me and that I understand the risks, alternatives and expected results of the anesthetic plan of care.
