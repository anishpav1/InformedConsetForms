Pharmacogenetic testing is used to help understand why some people respond better than others to certain
medications and why some people develop side effects while others do not. The Avera Institute for Human Genetics
(AIHG) Personalized Medicine Laboratory is authorized under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
and by all states to perform pharmacogenetic testing which is high-complexity testing. The results are not intended
to be used as the sole means for clinical diagnosis or patient management decisions. Pharmacogenetic testing
involves the testing of DNA, RNA or other products.
In order to have your pharmacogenetic testing completed, the following is important information for you to know and
understand:
 <ou are having a sample of blood drawn to examine pharmacogenetic information which may help your
provider understand how you may respond to different medications.
 Pharmacogenetic testing may yield uninterpretable results for the following reasons: 1) blood sample
contamination 2) insuf¿cient sample collection 3) incomplete knowledge of the available genetic markers
4) technical reasons.
 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally protects you against discrimination based
on your genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment.
 <our results will be released to clinicians directly involved in your care. Because of the important
implications, your results are con¿dential to the extent reTuired by law, and may only be released to other
medical professionals with your written consent.
 Pharmacogenetic testing is available as a fee-for-service test. By signing this, you understand that you
are responsible for what your insurance carrier does not pay. <ou will be responsible for payment after the
testing has begun, even if you decide not to receive results.
I have discussed and understand the risks and bene¿ts of this test. By signing this form, I authorize the use of my
sample to obtain results for tests indicated above. Furthermore, I authorize Avera McKennan Hospital & University
Health Center to retain, preserve, and use any data resulting from this test, as well as any leftover blood sample, for
scienti¿c or teaching purposes, or to dispose of at its convenience, unless initialed below.
______ By initialing here, I indicate my desire to opt out of participation in anonymous research studies using my
DNA sample. Receipt of this document ensures that my specimen will be destroyed upon completion of the
testing for which it was obtained.
