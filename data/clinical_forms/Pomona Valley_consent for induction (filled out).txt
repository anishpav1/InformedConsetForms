You are scheduled for an induction of labor on ___________________ (date) at ___________(time).
The reason for your scheduled induction is _____________________________________________.
The goal of induction of labor is to achieve vaginal delivery by starting uterine contractions before the spontaneous
start of labor. Elective induction of labor (scheduled induction without a medical indication) may not be done until you
are at least 39 weeks. This is important so that your newborn does not have complications due to possible
prematurity.
Fetal Maturity Criteria (Please complete for elective inductions)
Final EDC _______________________ as confirmed by
❏ LMP
❏ Ultrasound
❏ Fetal heart tones have been documented for 20 weeks by non−electronic fetoscope or for 30 weeks by doppler.
❏ 36 weeks have passed since a positive serum or urine HCG pregnancy was confirmed
❏ An ultrasound measurement of the crown−rump length, obtained between 6−11 weeks, supports a gestational
age of at least 39 weeks.
❏ An ultrasound scan, obtained at 12−20 weeks, confirms a gestational age of 39 weeks or more determined by
clinical history and physical exam
❏ 37 weeks have elapsed post−ovulation documented by ovulation predictor or since fertilization
Your cervical exam today is _____ centimeters dilated and ______ % effaced. The Bishop score is a scoring
system based on your cervical exam and your score today is ________. When the Bishop score is 7 or more, the
likelihood that you will have a vaginal birth is the same as that of natural labor. Induction of labor with a low Bishop
score has been associated with failure of induction, prolonged labor, and a high cesarean section rate.

If your Bishop score is low, your cervix is not "favorable" for induction. Your Physician may recommend a form of
cervical ripening:
❏ Misoprostol or Dinoprostone (Cervidil): this is a medicine placed in the vagina to make the cervix favorable.
Sometimes, it also starts labor. Oxytocin (Pitocin) will be started at a low dose and gradually increased until you
have regular, painful contractions. The side effects are related to the amount given and can result in too many
contractions in a short time (hyperstimulation) that may cause a temporary drop in the baby’s heart beat. Rarely,
hyperstimulation can lead to early separation of the placenta or afterbirth (abrouptio placentae) or rupture of the
uterus. If hyperstimulation occurs, the Pitocin may be temporarily stopped until contractions have slowed down and
the baby’s heart beat has returned to normal.

The alternative to induction of labor is to wait for labor to start spontaneously. I understand the risks and benefits of
this procedure and wish to proceed.

Policy Name: Cervical Ripening for a Viable Fetus Using
Cervadil or Misoprostol
Division: Department
Manuals
Origination Date: 5/1996

Policy #: WS#C.10

Manual: Women’s Services

Page #: 1 of 4

Revised Date: 7/2011

Reviewed Date: 7/2011

PURPOSE
To provide a guideline for the use of prostaglandin agents when used to initiate labor or effect
physical softening and distensibility of the cervix (cervical ripening) in preparation for labor and
birth.
POLICY
1. Cervical ripening is recommended for patients undergoing an induction with a Bishop
Score of less than 8.
2. Cervical ripening may be carried out by the LDRP Registered Nurse (RN) with the
written order of a physician.
3. The patient must have an informed consent for an induction of labor provided by
her physician and documented in the prenatal record or admission progress note.
4. The following should be assessed and documented in the chart prior to initiating
induction by administration of a cervical ripening agent:
a. Indication for Induction
b. Bishop Score
c. Fetal presentation
5. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (external or internal) is required.
INDICATIONS
Indications for Induction/Augmentation include:
1. Vascular diseases that are life threatening to the mother or infant in her second or third
trimester.
2. Preeclampsia
3. Rh incompatibility
4. Diabetes
5. Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM)
6. Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pPROM)
7. Chorioamnionitis
8. Term pregnancy greater than 39 weeks with a favorable cervix
9. Biophysical profile less than 6 or Oligohydramnios
10. Uterine dystocia – Poor quality contractions that do not produce cervical change.
11. Prevention of prolonged labor
12. Post Dates greater than 41 weeks gestation
CONTRAINDICATIONS
1. Contraindications for cervical ripening, induction or augmentation of labor are the same
as those for any contraindication to a vaginal delivery.
2. Use of Prostaglandins for cervical ripening in patients with a previous cesarean section
is not recommended. (ACOG, 2004, 2006b, 2009)

Policy Name: Cervical Ripening for a Viable Fetus Using

Page #: 2 of 4

Cervadil or Misoprostol

CONSIDERATIONS
For elective delivery at 39 completed weeks the following criteria must be met:
1. Fetal heart tones have been documented for 20 weeks by non-electronic fetoscope or
for 30 weeks by Doppler.
2. It has been 36 weeks since a serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy
test was found to be positive by a reliable laboratory.
3. Ultrasound measurement of the crown-rump length at 6-11 weeks of gestation supports
a gestational age equal to or greater than 39 weeks.
4. Ultrasound measurement at 12-20 weeks of gestation supports a clinically determined
gestational age of 39 weeks or greater.
5. For elective delivery at less than 39 completed weeks of gestation, and none of the
above criteria are met, fetal pulmonary maturity should be confirmed by amniocentesis.
DINOPROSTONE (CERVADIL) –a prostaglandin preparation used to ripen the cervix.
CONSIDERATIONS
1. Oxytocin and Cervadil are not to be administered concurrently.
2. Cervadil attenuates the contractile response to Oxytocin therefore administration of
Oxytocin should be delayed for 30 minutes after removal of cervadil insert.
3. Cervadil can cause tachysystole.
4. How prepared: Dinoprostone (Cervadil) 10 mG vaginal insert
EQUIPMENT
1. Sterile gloves
2. Cervadil insert
3. Lubricant
PROCEDURE
1. Ensure patient has had informed consent from her physician with documentation in the
prenatal record or admission progress note.
2. Obtain patient’s written consent.
3. Explain procedure to patient.
4. Apply continuous Fetal Monitor to asses Uterine Activity and assure Category I FHR
pattern prior to insertion of Cervadil.
5. Obtain Cervadil from pharmacy.
6. Assist patient to empty bladder.
7. Vital signs before insertion and 15 minutes after insertion, then routine as for laboring
patient.
8. Registered Nurse to insert Cervadil by positioning the insert between the index and
middle fingers. Place it transversely in the posterior fornix of the vagina with its long
axis transverse to the long axis of the vagina. Ensure cord remains attached to
Cervadil disk and long end protrudes from introitus to facilitate removal.
9. Remove Cervadil for the following:
a. For Tachysystole accompanied by FHR Category II or Category III.
b. After 12 hours
c. Upon onset of active labor

Policy Name: Cervical Ripening for a Viable Fetus Using

Cervadil or Misoprostol

d.

Oxytocin may be started 30 minutes after removal of Cervadil.

MISOPROSTOL (CYTOTEC) – a prostaglandin preparation used for the purpose of cervical
ripening prior to, and for induction of labor.
INDICATIONS
The same as for any induction.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
1. The same as those for any induction.
2. Additional contraindications for the use of misoprostol include:
a. Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin compound.
b. Clinically significant asthma.
c. Heart disease.
d. Frequent uterine contractions (more than 13 per hour).
e. Multiple gestation.
f. Absence of a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing.
g. Polyhydramnios
h. Patient refusal.
CONSIDERATIONS
1. Oxytocin and Misoprostol are not to be administered concurrently.
2. Plasma concentrations of Misoprostol rise gradually and decline slowly. Therefore
Oxytocin administration may be initiated no sooner than 4 hours after last dose of
Misoprostol.
3. Misoprosol can cause tachysystole.
4. How prepared: Misoprostol (Cytotek) 25 microgram (1/4 tablet of 100 microgram
tablet).
PROCEDURE
1. Ensure patient has had informed consent from her physician with documentation in the
prenatal record or admission progress note.
2. Prepare equipment and obtain 25 micrograms of Misoprostol.
3. Perform vaginal examination and Leopold’s maneuvers to determine presentation and
lie.
4. Prepare patient for insertion and explain procedure.

Your doctor may recommend the use of a medication called Oxytocin (Pitocin) to increase the amount and/or strength
of your contractions. This is called "Augmentation" and is used when your contractions do not result in continuing
cervical dilation or movement downward (descent) of your baby.
Your current cervical exam is _________ cm dilated and _______% effaced.
Your baby’s head is at _________ station.
Station tells you the location of your baby on its way down the birth canal. Negative numbers mean the baby is higher
in the pelvis, positive means lower in the pelvis.
Oxytocin (Pitocin) will be started at a low dose and gradually increased until you have regular contractions. These
contractions should be stronger than the ones you will be having and therefore should be more effective in causing
further dilation. The side effects are related to the amount given; therefore the dose is closely monitored by your nurse
and physician. If there are too many contractions in a short time (hyperstimulation), a temporary drop in the baby’s
heartbeat may occur. If hyperstimulation occurs and heartbeat drops, the Pitocin will be stopped until the contractions
have slowed down and the baby’s heartbeat has returned to normal. Rarely, hyperstimulation can lead to early
separation of the placenta or afterbirth (abruptio placentae) or rupture of the uterus; either of these complications would
require a Cesarean Section.
The alternative to Pitocin augmentation is to continue labor without assistance. There are risks to prolonged or
ineffective labor that include:
● Increased risk of infection in your baby
● Increased risk of infection in you
● Hemorrhage (excessive bleeding)
● Increased need for Cesarean Section
My doctor has explained these risks and benefits; I understand and wish to proceed with augmentation.
Su médico está recomendando el uso de un medicamento denominado oxitocina (Pitocin) para aumentar la cantidad y/o
intensidad de las contracciones. Eso se conoce como "inducción de contracciones uterinas" y se usa cuando las
contracciones no dan lugar a contracciones cervicales continuas ni al dezplazamiento decendente (hacia abajo) de su
bebé.

xi	cXVdfyzxÿ ÿ rÿ*COÿ0ÿ20*ÿr ÿ ÿ

Su examen cervical actual indica _______ cm de dilatación y un ________ % de borramiento del cuello uterino.
La cabeza de su bebé se encuentra en la estación ________.
Las estaciones indican la ubicación del bebé en vías del parto. Un número negativo significa que el bebé se encuentra
más arriba en la pelvis y uno positivo que se encuentra más abajo.

Se comenzará a administrar oxitocina (Pitocin) a una dosis baja y se aumentará gradualmente hasta que presente
contracciones regulares. Estas contracciones deben ser más intensas de las que tiene acutalmente y por lo tanto deben
ser más eficaces en producir una mayor dilatación. Los efectos secundarios están asociados con la cantidad de
medicamento administrado; por lo tanto, su enfermera y médico darán seguimiento estrecho a las dosis. Si se producen
demasiadas contracciones durante un período breve (hiperestimulación), puede ocurrir un descenso temporal en los
latidos del corazón de su bebé. Si ocurre hiperestimulación y se reducen los latidos cardíacos, se suspenderá el uso de
Pitocin hasta que disminuyan las contracciones y los latidos del bebé se normalicen. En raras ocasiones la
hiperestimulatión puede causar la separación prematura de la prematura de la placenta o expulsión de secundinas
(abrupción placentaria) o desgarramiento del útero. Estas complicaciones requieren practicar parto por cesárea.
La alternativa a la inducción con de contracciones uterinas con Pitocin es seguir con el trabajo de parto sin ayuda. Hay
riesgos asociados con un trabajo de parto prolongado o ineficaz, por ejemplo:
● Mayor riesgo de infección para el bebé
● Mayor riesgo de infección para usted
● Hemorragia (sangrado excesivo)
● Mayor necesidad de un parto por cesárea

Mi médico me ha explicado estos riesgos y beneficios. Entiendo los mismos y deseo proceder con el procedimiento de
inducción de contracciones uterinas.

PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the care of a woman undergoing an induction or augmentation of
labor. The goal of induction of labor is to achieve vaginal delivery by stimulating uterine
contractions before the spontaneous onset of labor. The goal of augmentation of labor is to
enhance inadequate uterine contractions.
POLICY
Intravenous oxytocin (Pitocin) as ordered by the physician and clinically and or
psychosocially indicated may be used to induce or augment uterine contractions
providing the following criteria are met:
A.

Personnel who are familiar with the effects of oxytocin and able to identify both
maternal and fetal complications will be in attendance during the administration
of oxytocin.
B.
The patient’s prenatal record will be on the patient’s chart before the induction
is started to confirm gestational age of 39 weeks for non-medically or clinically
indicated inductions.
C.
Once the infusion is started, the physician must be readily available to manage
any complications, including an emergency cesarean delivery. ACOG(1999)
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Generally, the contraindications to labor inductions are the same as those for spontaneous
labor and vaginal delivery. They include, but are not limited to, the following situations:
A.
Vasa previa or complete placenta previa
B.
Unfavorable fetal positions or presentations which are undeliverable without
conversion prior to delivery i.e. transverse lie.
C.
Umbilical cord prolapse
D.
Previous transfundal uterine surgery ACOG(1999)
EQUIPMENT
A. Electronic Fetal Monitor
B. Primary IV solution per physician order
C. IV with Oxytocin as ordered by physician per preprinted Induction/Augmentation
Physician Orders
D. Automatic infusion pumps
E. Sterile exam gloves
PROCEDURE
I.
Complete assessment to obtain baseline values of mother and fetus as follows:
A.
B.

Determine baseline blood pressure, pulse, respirations and temperature on
mother.
Determine baseline fetal heart rate via electronic continuous fetal monitoring,
documenting baseline FHR, and variability, the presence of periodic or episodic
accelerations and decelerations and uterine contraction pattern. Monitor for a
minimum of 30 minutes to assess fetal well being.

II.

Review the patient’s chart for induction indications, medical and nursing assessment
of fetal/maternal status and clarity of physician’s orders.

III.

Complete the pre-Oxytocin checklist and document in the electronic medical record.
(See Addendum)

IV.

Verify informed consent for induction or augmentation of labor.

V.

Confirm gestational age.

VI.

Immediately prior to starting the Oxytocin infusion, a pelvic examination of the patient
is done by the physician or competent RN. For a Bishop Score of less than 7, contact
physician for orders / contraindications for cervical ripening agent.

VII.

Insert intravenous catheter and begin infusion of main-line IV solution as ordered by
Physician.

VIII.

Use Premixed infusion obtained from Medication Administration System: 20 units
Oxytocin in 1000 ml 0.9% Normal Saline Solution and connect to IV tubing without
injection ports.

IX.

Obtain electronic infusion pump.

X.

Label tubing with Oxytocin label at point of insertion site and at pump. Connect
Oxytocin infusion at port closest to insertion site.

XI.

Start Oxytocin at 2 milliunits/minute via infusion pump as ordered per preprinted
Induction/Augmentation Physician Orders

XII.

Place the patient on strict intake and output monitoring.

XIII.

Maintain the induction as follows:
A.

B.

C.

The fetal heart rate and contraction pattern will be evaluated and documented
as follows:
1.
When starting Oxytocin infusion
2.
15 minutes after initiating infusion and after any rate adjustments
(increase or decrease)
3.
Q 30 minutes during maintenance
For a Category III fetal heart rate tracing, discontinue Oxytocin and initiate
intrauterine resuscitation measures as indicated. Contact primary physician
immediately.
For Tachysystole (a uterine contraction pattern of more than 5 UCs in a 10
minute window) perform the following interventions:
1. Category I Tracing – reposition to lateral recumbent and administer 500 mL
IV bolus of mainline fluid and observe for 15 minutes. If Tachysystole
unresolved 15 minutes after intervention, decrease Oxytocin rate by ½ and
observe for additional 15 minutes. If Tachysystole unresolved after 30
minutes, discontinue Oxytocin and notify primary physician.
2. Category II tracing: Recurrent variable or late decelerations with moderate
variability – Reduce Oxytocin infusion rate by ½, reposition patient to lateral
recumbent and give 500 mL IV bolus of mainline fluid. Observe for 15
minutes. If no improvement, discontinue Oxytocin infusion and notify
primary physician.

3. Category II tracing: recurrent variable or late decelerations with minimal
variability – Discontinue Oxytocin, reposition to lateral recumbent,
administer 500 mL IV bolus of mainline fluid and observe for 15 minutes.
Consider administration of oxygen and/or tocolytic mediation (Terbutaline
0.25 mG SQ X 1)
4. When Tachysystole resolves:
a. If Oxytocin has been off less than 30 minutes, restart at ½ the rate when
discontinued.
b. If Oxytocin has been off longer than 30 minutes, restart at 2
milliunits/minute and increase per induction/augmentation physician
orders.
Maternal blood pressure and pulse will be monitored and recorded q 30
minutes.
Advance to next dosage level per L&D Oxytocin Department Order Set every
30 minutes until adequate labor as uterine activity indicates, not to exceed 2
mU/min (12 ml/hr) every 30 minutes and to a maximum dose of 20 mU/min
(120ml/hr.)
When 20 mU/min. has been reached if patient is not in labor as evidenced by
cervical change, notify physician and when ordered by physician, Oxytocin
infusion may be increased beyond 20 mU/ min but must have an IUPC in
place.).
Once an effective contraction pattern is established (5 contractions or less in 10
minutes, lasting 90 seconds or less, and moderate in strength as indicated by
palpation or 50-70mmHg via IUPC) hold the oxytocin at that rate or decrease
the infusion and determine if a regular contraction pattern will be maintained.
