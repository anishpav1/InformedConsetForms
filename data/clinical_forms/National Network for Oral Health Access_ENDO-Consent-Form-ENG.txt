PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT FOR ENDODONTIC TREATMENT
I hereby authorize a _______ DENTIST / DENTAL RESIDENT / DENTAL STUDENT to perform a
ROOT CANAL TREATMENT on tooth number: _______________________________________
I understand that a root canal treatment is a procedure to retain a tooth, which may otherwise require extraction.
Although root canal treatment has a very high degree of clinical success, it is still a biological procedure, so its
success cannot be guaranteed.
I (or my child/ward), __________________________________, have been informed that I (or my child/ward)
require an endodontic procedure (root canal treatment) to retain this tooth and that I fully understand the
following:
1. Failure to follow this recommendation will most likely result in:
1. The loss of the tooth
2. Bone destruction due to an abscess
3. Possible systemic (affecting the whole body) infection
2. 5 to 10% of root canal treatments fail and may require re-treatment, periapical surgery, or even
extraction.
3. During cleaning of the tooth, tools may break and lodge permanently in the tooth. Also, an
instrument may perforate the root wall. Although this occurs rarely, broken tools or perforation can
cause root canal treatments to fail. This may lead to the need of further more complex treatment or
referral to Root Canal Specialists (Endodontist) or loss of the tooth.
4. Possible complications associated with root canal treatments are cracked teeth, blocked canals,
curved roots, and gum disease. These are rare complications that can make the treatment impossible.
5. During or after the root canal treatment, there are some complications that could arise. These
possible complications include: swelling, bleeding, pain, infection, permanent or temporary
numbness / tingling of the lip and or tongue.
6. On occasion, while performing the root canal treatment, the cleaning solution used can cause sudden
pain followed by rapid swelling that can last for a while. This pain and swelling will go away with
time. Treatment involves waiting and taking pain medications if needed.
7. When making an access (opening) through an existing crown or placing a rubber dam clamp,
damage could occur to the existing crown and a new crown may be necessary following endodontic
therapy.
8. Successful completion of the root canal treatment does not prevent future decay or fracture of the
tooth.
9. Temporary fillings are usually placed in the tooth following root canal treatment. These
endodontically treated teeth usually need a buildup and a crown will be required in order to restore
the tooth to proper function and appearance. Failure to place the recommended final restoration,
such as a crown, on a completed root canal treated tooth can result in tooth fracture or recurrent
decay which in turn can result in failure of the root canal and eventual need for retreatment or
extraction.
There are risks involved in administration of anesthetics, analgesics (pain medication), and antibiotics. I
will inform the Doctor of any previous side effects or allergies.
