Consent for Biopsy with Local Anesthesia
I understand that due to the type of lesion I have, Dr. Zidile has recommended that I undergo a biopsy,
which is a procedure in which a portion of the lesion will be removed. The expected result of this
procedure is to adequately diagnose the lesion type.
I understand that there are risks and complications associated with this procedure, which include but
are not limited to infection, need for another biopsy to be performed, and scarring.
Understanding all of the above, I request that and hereby provide my informed consent to the treating
doctor and his assistants to perform a biopsy. I understand that in the course of the biopsy it may
become necessary to perform additional procedures which are not known to be needed at this time. I
request that and hereby provide my informed consent to have Dr. Zidile to perform such procedures at
his discretion if needed during my biopsy.
I consent to having local anesthesia. I understand the performance of diagnostic studies relating to my
biopsy will be performed by other medical/dental professionals.
