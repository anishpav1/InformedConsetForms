INFORMED CONSENT FOR MRI
WITH OR WITHOUT CONTRAST INJECTION

DOB: _____/_____/_____

PATIENT NAME: ___________________________________

I, the undersigned, being either the patient named above or legally authorized representative of the patient named above, do
hereby consent to the performance of medical diagnostic and imaging procedures at Molecular Imaging, LLC on the terms
and conditions more fully set out below. I understand that I have the right to be informed about the diagnostic imaging
procedure being used so that I may make the decision whether or not to undergo the procedure.
1. Consent to Imaging Procedure: Your attending physician believes it beneficial for you to undergo a diagnostic
imaging procedure known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain additional information that may aid in diagnosing
and treating your medical condition It has been explained to me that MRI does not use x-rays or radiation. Instead a magnetic
field and radio waves are used to create an image of internal body structures. MRI is a painless procedure that only requires
that you lie quietly on a padded table that gently glides you into the magnet. While the scanner is performing your scan, you
will hear some humming and thumping sounds. These are normal and should not worry you. In some cases, a contrast agent
may be injected into your vein in order to give a clearer image of the area being examined. The MRI study may be conducted
without the injection of contrast, but the images may not be as helpful to the radiologist and your physician. Inform the
technologist if you wish to refuse the contrast injection.
2. Because of the magnetic field and radio frequencies, people with a heart pacemaker, brain aneurysm clips, and
some implanted metallic or electrical devices should not have an MRI. It is important that you inform the technologist if you
have any of these metallic appliances. Please inform the technologist if you are pregnant or think that you may be
pregnant.
3. Potential Risks: Anytime an injection is given there is the potential for bruising or swelling at the injection site.
Occasionally, minor allergic reactions occur in the form of itching, sneezing, hives, swelling of the eyes, wheezing or nausea.
These symptoms may require treatment with medication we have at hand. Rarely, a more serious reaction will occur. A
radiologist will evaluate the situation and determine if additional medical treatment is necessary. Even though it is rare,
medical statistics indicated that a fatality might occur from the injection of contrast. If you have had an allergic reaction or
have sickle cell anemia or kidney/liver disorder, asthma, or are pregnant or breast-feeding, You MUST inform the
technologist.
4. The benefit of this exam is to assist your physician with making a diagnosis. There may be other imaging
alternatives, however your physician believes the MRI to be the best diagnostic test for you, after evaluating your symptoms
and medical condition.
By my signature below, I hereby certify that I have fully read this consent, had it explained to me or have had it read to me. I
have been given an opportunity to ask questions about my condition, alternative forms of treatment, and the procedures to be
used, and the risks and hazards involved.
I understand its contents and have sufficient information to give this informed consent.
