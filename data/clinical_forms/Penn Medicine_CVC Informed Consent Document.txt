CONSENT FOR
CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER PLACEMENT

INTRODUCTION:

Your physician has requested that you have a central venous catheter inserted.

This catheter will allow your condition to be more closely monitored and can be used for the administration of
intravenous fluids, medications and nutrition. We are asking you to read and sign this form so that we can be
sure y o u understand the procedure and potential benefits, along with the associated potential risks,
complications, alternatives, the likelihood of achieving the goals, and the recuperative process. Please ask
questions about anything on this form that you do not understand.
PROCEDURE: A central venous catheter is a thin, sterile plastic intravascular tube that is inserted into
a large blood vessel (central vein) in your neck, upper chest or groin. Before the catheter is inserted, numbing
medicine will be injected in the skin over the blood vessel that will be used. A needle will guide the entry of the
catheter through the skin, a small incision will be made and catheter will be entered into the appropriate vessel.
Once the catheter is correctly positioned, the outside end of it will be sutured to your skin and then covered with
a bandage. If the catheter is inserted into a vessel in either your neck or upper chest, a chest x-ray will be taken
to make sure that it is in the correct location once the insertion procedure is finished. An x-ray is not needed if
the catheter is inserted into a vessel in your groin.
RISKS: Risks associated with the insertion of a central venous catheter include but are not limited to
damage to the local vein or artery; bleeding; localized pain; infection at the insertion site or a blood stream
infection; blockage of the blood vessel; and injury to the chest or lungs including bleeding (hemothorax) or a
collapsed lung (pneumothorax). The development of an infection may result in the need for antibiotics. In
addition to these potential risks associated with a central venous catheter insertion, the1·e may be other
unexpected risks or complications, including death.

ALTERNATIVES:

There may be other ways to monitor your condition and collect the information

that is obtained by a central venous catheter, along with other ways to administer intravenous fluids,
medications and nutrition. These include administering fluid, medication and nutrition through a peripheral
intravenous catheter. A peripheral intravenous catheter will need to be removed and replaced on a regular basis.
If you are unsure about undergoing insertion of a central venous catheter, please discuss these possible
alternatives with your physician including the relevant risks, benefits and side effects related to the alternatives
and the possible result of not receiving care, treatment and services.
