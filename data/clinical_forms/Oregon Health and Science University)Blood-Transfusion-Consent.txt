I have reviewed the points in the information sheet “What You Should Know About Blood
Transfusion” including information about the benefits of blood products, the potential risks of blood
transfusion and the alternatives to transfusion. My physician or practitioner has asked me if I want a more
detailed explanation about the transfusion and if I have any additional questions. My questions have
been answered; the transfusion, alternatives and risks have been explained to me in substantial detail; and
I am satisfied with the explanations. I have no additional questions about the procedure, treatments,
other alternatives, methods of treatment and risks.
I agree to accept the risks and consequences of blood transfusion and understand that I am free to change
my mind at any time regarding this.

What You Should Know About Blood Transfusion
As part of your care at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), it may be necessary for you to receive blood
products. Please read this information sheet and discuss any questions you may have with your doctor.
Except in emergencies, OHSU requires your written consent for transfusion.
1. Benefits of blood products: Your doctor will transfuse blood products only when he or she
believes the benefits to you are greater than the risks. Blood products your doctor may use are:
• Red Blood Cells – to correct anemia; to increase oxygen delivery to the body.
• Platelets – to help your blood to clot and reduce bleeding.
• Plasma – to help your blood to clot and reduce bleeding.
• White Blood Cells – to help you fight infection.
2. Potential Risks of Blood Transfusion: Risks of blood transfusion are low.
• Most common reactions, rarely dangerous (about 1:100): Chills, fever, itching, rash or hives.
• Rare but more serious reactions: Shortness of breath, wheezing, low blood pressure (dizziness), very dark
urine or blood in urine, kidney damage.
• Very rare, but potentially life-threatening reactions (less than 1:100,000): Severe transfusion reaction with
shock; bacterial infection. Infections such as hepatitis or HIV (AIDS)--weeks later.
• Theoretical risk—not proven to be associated with transfusion: “Mad Cow” Disease
To Outpatients Receiving Blood Products: Reactions to blood are rare and most occur during transfusion or
within a few hours of transfusion. After you go home, if you experience any of the symptoms listed above or think
you might be having a reaction to blood call your doctor or the clinic. There will be someone on call after
hours. If your symptoms seem to be serious ones, go to the emergency room.
3. Blood Safety Measures: The American Red Cross supplies most of the blood used at
OHSU. The Red Cross carefully selects donors and tests the donated blood to minimize the risk of
infection. OHSU relies on these procedures to insure safety. Before transfusion, OHSU will determine your
blood group and Rh type, screen you for unusual antibodies, and crossmatch your blood with the blood you
will receive to help assure the blood is compatible.
4. Alternatives to Red Cross donor blood: There may be blood alternatives depending on your
condition and the time involved. Each alternative has its own risks. Some alternatives are:
• Drugs to help you make blood (erythropoietin--EPO): It takes weeks to months to replace red cells.
• Your own blood (autologous donation): Donated before surgery or collected during surgery:
Donations before surgery are made at the Red Cross 2 - 5 weeks before your operation. Giving your own
blood does not guarantee you will not need other donor blood. It can also have side effects--you can have a
reaction to donating and it can make you more anemic before surgery.
• Drugs to reduce bleeding: Some drugs can decrease bleeding during surgery, but cannot replace lost
platelets or clotting factors.
• Directed Donors: OHSU will accept blood donated for you by relatives and friends provided their blood is
compatible with yours and they meet standard Red Cross donation criteria. Directed donor blood has not been
proven to be any safer than regular Red Cross donor blood and may be less safe. Because of this, if you
don’t use the donated blood, current Portland Red Cross and OHSU policy do not permit its transfusion
to someone else. A “directed donor fee” is also charged for each directed donation. Preparation of the
blood takes 4-5 days and blood from a relative must be irradiated to be safe for you.
5. Bloodless Medicine & Surgery:
OHSU respects the right of those who refuse transfusion for religious or other reasons. A consultation can be
arranged with the OHSU Transfusion Service to explore alternatives to transfusion more fully.
