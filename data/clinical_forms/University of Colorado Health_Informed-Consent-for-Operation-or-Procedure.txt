Patient Information Sheet for Consent for Allograft / Xenograft
Allograft/xenograft is a bone or tissue product developed from human or animal sources. There are possible risks with
implanting these types of products. Risks include reactions to the bone/tissue and infections such as hepatitis and HIV. These
risks can be serious and possibly fatal.
Patient Information Sheet for Consent for Blood Transfusion
Procedure: In the course of your care, you may need a transfusion of blood and or one of its products. These transfusions may
include whole blood, red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, or cryoprecipitate.
Risks: The risks of blood transfusion include serious allergic reactions and reactions that can damage your own blood cells.
Infections such as viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a viral infection that causes acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS), can be transmitted with transfusions. The chance of transmitting infection is considered to be less than one in a
million transfusions. These risks can be serious and possibly fatal.
Alternatives: The risks of NOT receiving blood far outweigh the risks of a transfusion. Additional options for your specific procedure
may include pre-donation of your own blood (autologous blood donation) or the use of cell saver during surgery. If you refuse blood
or blood products (donated, autologous, or use of cell saver), the risks may include organ damage from inadequate oxygen supply,
inability to control bleeding, and sometimes death.
