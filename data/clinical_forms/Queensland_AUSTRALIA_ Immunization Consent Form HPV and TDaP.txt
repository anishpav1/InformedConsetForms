CONSENT FORM YEAR 7
CONSENT for Vaccination: parent/legal guardian to read and sign
I am authorised as the parent or legal guardian of the listed child to give consent for the child to be vaccinated. I have
read and I understand the information given to me about human papillomavirus vaccine and diphtheria-tetanuspertussis vaccine including risks and side effects.
I have been given the opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with my doctor or by telephoning the
Gold Coast Immunisation team on 1800 940 750 or 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84).
I understand that Queensland Health will record immunisation details, forward them to the Australian Immunisation
Register and Vaccine monitoring service for the purpose of clinical follow up or disease prevention, control and
monitoring.
I understand that I can change my consent at any time. If I wish to change consent:
- up to 2 business days before immunisation takes place at the school, I understand I need to do so by making a written
request via email to Gold Coast Public Health Unit at immuniseGC@health.qld.gov.au.
- within 2 business days of immunisation, I understand that I need to send a signed written request of changes with my
child to take to the school immunisation team or alternatively I need to meet in person with the school immunisation
team to confirm that changes to my child's consent have been received.
