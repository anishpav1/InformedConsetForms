ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Page 2
I acknowledge I have received and understand the information on both pages of this
consent form or it has been clearly read reviewed with me.
I understand the
information contained in it, including all of the technical terms, about which I have
asked if unsure. I have been given an adequate opportunity to ask whatever
questions I have about the treatment. All of the questions about the treatment
have been answered in a satisfactory manner.
I understand that the success of this treatment and the avoidance of treatment
complications depend, to an extent, upon my compliance with oral hygiene, personal
habit restrictions, and dietary restrictions that have been explained to me. I
further understand keeping the appointments for follow up are also extremely
important. Lastly, I understand I am to notify the dentist immediately with ANY
suspected complications as further treatment may be discussed/administered that
was not initially anticipated.
I hereby authorize and direct Kirby L. Hart, III, D.M.D., his assistants, or associate
of his choice to perform the diagnostic, surgical or dental treatments. This consent
form will remain valid until revoked by me, the patient, in writing. All blanks were
completed prior to my signature. I waive any further disclosures or information.

PATIENT AGREEMENT
Please initial and sign.
______As a courtesy to our patients using insurance, we are happy to file claims on your behalf. All
benefits quoted are estimates only and not a guarantee of payment. If you have questions regarding
your coverage, please contact your insurance company directly.
______If insurance coverage is terminated or has not been updated with Hartford Family Dentistry,
the patient will be responsible for all incurred charges.
______Hartford Family Dentistry provides the most up-to-date services. These services include, but
are not limited to, composite (tooth-colored) fillings, restorative cosmetic dentistry, and implant
dentistry. Insurance companies may not cover all procedures. In these cases, the patient will be
responsible for any unpaid balances.
______Treatment plans and associated fees may change without notice if it is in the best interest of
the patient at the time of treatment.
______All estimated fees are due at the time of treatment. We are happy to discuss finance options.
All financial arrangements must be made before any treatment is rendered.
______Appointments that are 60 minutes in length or more will require prepayment prior to
scheduling.
______After 90 days, all outstanding balances will be forwarded to our collection agency.
______One American dies every hour due to ORAL CANCER. For this reason, we conduct an oral
cancer screening once per year starting at the first scheduled exam. If our dental insurance does not
cover this procedure, the patient will be billed $24.00.
______Although fluoride treatments for ADULTS are not usually a covered benefit of most dental
insurance policies, they are proven to protect our teeth against new decay by 75%; we strongly
recommend for ALL patients. If your dental insurance does not cover this procedure, the patient will
be billed $24.00.
______I authorize and give consent to Hartford Family Dentistry to perform the dental services
agreed between doctor and patient or parent/guardian to be necessary and advisable including the
use of local anesthesia and other medications as indicated.
_____Because time for all of us is valuable, we ask for a MINIMUM 24 hour notice for any
appointment cancellations or reschedules. Please understand the appointment reserved especially
for you is difficult at best to fill if not given adequate time to do so. Our team does a great job in

reaching out with courtesy appointment reminders. However, if we are unable to confirm the
appointment with you we will be left with no other option but to cancel the appointment and offer to
another patient who may need our care.

I understand that I am ultimately responsible for all services rendered. In the case of
default, I am responsible for the cost of attorney’s fees, court costs, and the cost of collection
proceedings. I also waive the right to have any amounts owed discharged in bankruptcy.

YOUR DENTAL INSURANCE IS A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY…
but we can help!
Regardless of what we might calculate as your dental benefit in dollars, we must
stress the fact that you, the patient, are responsible for the TOTAL TREATMENT
FEE.
As a courtesy to you, we do accept the assignment of benefit payments from most
insurance companies. This will reduce your immediate out-of-pocket expenditures.
Our estimate is based on limited information obtained from your insurance
company. We will allow 45 days for your insurance company to make payment.

AFTER THIS TIME, ALL FOLLOW UP ON PAYMENTS DUE BECOME YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY.
