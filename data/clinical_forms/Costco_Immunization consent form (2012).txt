ADVERSE REACTIONS
A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of any vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.
Local symptoms may include: slight tenderness, redness, itching or swelling at the site of injection.
Systemic symptoms may include: fever, malaise and muscle pain. Other systemic symptoms may occur infrequently. These reactions usually begin 6 to 12 hours after immunization and can
persist for a few days. Immediate presumable allergic reactions such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma or systemic anaphylaxis occur rarely after immunization. These reactions may result
from hypersensitive reactions in people with severe egg allergy, and such people should not be given certain vaccines that contain eggs. People with documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)mediated hypersensitivities to eggs or any other vaccine components, including thimerosal, may also be at increased risk of reactions from immunizations.
In the case of a severe reaction such as a high fever, behavior changes or flu-like symptoms that occur after vaccination, see a doctor right away. Signs of an allergic reaction can include
difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot.
I have read the adverse reactions associated with the administration of vaccines. A copy of the vaccine manufacturer’s drug information sheet is available on request. Furthermore, I have also
had an opportunity to ask questions about these immunizations. I believe the benefits outweigh the risks and I voluntarily assume full responsibility for any reactions that may result from either
my receipt of the immunization(s) or the receipt of the immunization(s) by the person named below for whom I am the legal guardian (‘Ward’). My medical record may be shared with my physician
or other healthcare provider and the medical record of my Ward may be shared with his/her physician or other healthcare provider. I am requesting that the immunization(s) be given to me or my
Ward. I, for myself and on behalf of my Ward, and each of our respective heirs, executors, personal representatives and assigns, hereby release Costco, and its affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions,
directors, contractors, agents and employees (collectively “Released Parties”), from any and all claims arising out of, in connection with or in any way related to my receipt and the receipt by my
Ward of this or these immunization(s). Neither Costco nor any of the Released Parties shall, at any time or to any extent whatsoever, be liable, responsible or any way accountable for any loss,
injury, death or damage suffered or sustained by any person at any time in connection with or as a result of this vaccine program or the administration of the vaccines described above. Costco will
use and disclose your personal and health information or the personal and health information of your Ward, to treat you or your Ward, to receive payment of the care we provide, and for other
health care operations. Healthcare operations generally include those activities we perform to improve the quality of care. We have prepared a detailed NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES to help
you better understand our policies in regard to you and your Ward’s personal health information. I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices.
