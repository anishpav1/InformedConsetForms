Informed Consent for Genetic Testing

Testing for genetic conditions can be complex. If warranted, obtain professional genetic counseling prior to giving consent to fully understand what the risks
and benefits are to having the testing completed. Refer to test specific information (general description of the test, purpose and description of associated
disease(s)) found at: www.mayomedicallaboratories.com.
I hereby consent to participate in testing for _________________________________________________ using a genetic test.
I understand that a biologic specimen (blood, tissue, amniotic fluid, or chorionic villi) will be obtained from me and/or members of my family.
I understand that this biologic specimen will be used for the purpose of attempting to determine if I and members of my family are carriers of the disease
gene, or are affected with, or at increased risk to someday be affected with this genetic disease.
It has been explained to me and I understand that:
This test is specific for _________________________________________________.
• A positive result is an indication that I may
be predisposed to or have the specific disease,
or condition. Further testing may be needed
to confirm the diagnosis. I understand I will be
given the opportunity to talk with my physician
or a genetic counselor about these results.

• T here is a chance that I will have this genetic
condition but that the genetic test results will
be negative. Due to limitations in technology
and incomplete knowledge of genes, some
changes in DNA or protein products that cause
disease, may not be detected by the test.

• T here may be a possibility that the laboratory
findings will be uninterpretable or of unknown
significance. In rare circumstances, findings
may be suggestive of a condition different than
the diagnosis that was originally considered.

• In many cases, a genetic test directly detects an abnormality.
Molecular testing may detect a change in the DNA (mutation).
Cytogenetic testing may identify whether there is extra, missing
or rearranged genetic material. Biochemical methods are sometimes
used to look at abnormalities in the protein products that are produced
by the genes. Most tests are highly sensitive and specific. However,
sensitivity and specificity are test dependent.

 ecause of the complexity of genetic testing and the important
• B
implications of the test results, results will be reported only through
a physician, genetic counselor, or other identified health care provider.
The results are confidential to the extent allowed by law. They will only
be released to other medical professionals or other parties with my written
consent or as otherwise allowed by law. Participation in genetic testing is
completely voluntary.

• T he accuracy of the test depends on correct family history. An error
in diagnosis may occur if the true biological relationships of the family
members involved in this study are not as I have stated. In addition,
testing may inadvertently detect non-paternity. Non-paternity means
that the father of an individual is not the person stated to be the father.

• I understand that Mayo Medical Laboratories is not a specimen banking
facility and my sample will not be available after 60 days or for future
clinical studies. I understand that my specimen will only be used for the
genetic testing as authorized by my consent and that my sample will
not be used in any identifiable fashion for research purposes without
my consent.

• A n erroneous clinical diagnosis in a family member can lead
to an incorrect diagnosis for other related individuals in question.

• A dditional testing information can be found at:

• T he tests offered are considered to be the best available at this time.
This testing is often complex and utilizes specialized materials. However
there is always a small chance an error may occur.
