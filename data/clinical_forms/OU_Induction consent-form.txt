CONSENT FORM FOR ELECTIVE INDUCTION OF LABOR
(“elective” means that the induction of labor is being done without medical indications)

I hereby authorize Dr ___________________ and/or other medical staff, including medical students and residents and
fellows in training of the physician’s choice, to perform upon
(patient’s name)_________________
an elective induction of labor and any other surgical or diagnostic procedures that may be required to complete the
delivery of my baby. I have discussed the risks and benefits of this procedure with my physician. I accept the risks of the
procedure as opposed to allowing labor to begin spontaneously at a later date.
PLEASE INITIAL EACH PARAGRAPH. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK THE DOCTOR BEFORE INITIALLING
The established risks of elective induction of labor are:
______ An increased risk of the need for cesarean birth (surgical abdominal birth). This risk is greater if this is your first
pregnancy at term, and if your body has not yet prepared the cervix (opening of the uterus) for labor.
______ Risk that the induction will not establish labor. I have discussed this risk with my physician and I understand that if
the induction does not result in labor, I may be released to my home when it is safe for me and my fetus to do so.
______ I have also discussed the use of cervical “ripening agents” with my physician and I understand their separate risks
of:
a. Too many contractions of the uterus to the point that my fetus may become unstable and require
emergency delivery, either vaginally or by cesarean birth.
b. I also understand that rarely the uterus may rupture under these circumstances and cause the death of
my fetus and severe bleeding , long-term complications or death to myself.
_____ I understand that if I have a cesarean birth, I am likely to require cesarean births for all future children I may deliver. I
understand that each cesarean birth will carry the risks associated with surgical abdominal birth. I understand that certain
risks of these following cesarean births also exist.
_____ An increased risk that instruments (forceps or vacuum extractor) may be used to accomplish a vaginal delivery, if
necessary.
_____ I acknowledge that there may be an increased risk for the need of blood transfusion, and I give my full consent to
receive blood and blood products as necessary unless specifically stated here:___________________________________
_____ I have discussed the risks associated with various drugs and anesthetic techniques that may be used to reduce the
pain associated with labor and delivery, either vaginally or by cesarean birth, and I understand and accept these risks.
_____ I understand the nature and the purpose of these procedures. The risks, benefits, possibility of complications, as
well as expected results and medical alternatives, have been explained to me by my physician.
