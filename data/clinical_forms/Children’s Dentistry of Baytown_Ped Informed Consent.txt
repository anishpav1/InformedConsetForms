PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY INFORMED CONSENT FORM
The AAPD (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry) recognizes that, in providing oral health care for our patients, behavior
management techniques may be needed during the dental visit. The goal of the behavior management is to promote a positive
dental attitude, safety and quality of care on our patients. There are various Behavior Management Techniques used. There are
non-pharmacological and pharmacological behavior management techniques that may be used by the dental health care
providers. We want to educate and inform you as the parent/legal guardian of them.
The following are non-pharmacological techniques:
_____

Tell-show-do: The dentist or dental assistant explains to the child what will be done using simple terminology and
repetition and then shows the child what is to be done by demonstrating with instruments on a model, or the child's or
dentist's finger. The procedure is performed in the child's mouth as described. Praise and compliments are used to
reinforce cooperative behavior.

____

Positive reinforcement: This technique rewards the child who displays any behavior which is desirable. Examples of
rewards include: compliments, encouragement, praises, or prizes.

____

Voice Control: The attention of a disruptive child is gained by changing the tone or increasing the volume of the dentist's
voice. Content of the conversation is less important than the abrupt or sudden nature of the command.

____

Mouth Props "tooth pillow": A soft, rubber device used to assist the child in keeping their mouth open during a
procedure.

____

Protective stabilization by the dentist and/or the dental assistant-Very rarely used (only if absolutely necessary with
additional verbal and written consent): The dentist or dental assistant gently protects the child from movement by
holding the child's hands/or upper body, stabilizing the child's head or positioning the child safely in the dental chair.

The following are pharmacological techniques:
____

Nitrous Oxide "laughing gas": Only used with additional verbal and written consent. Nitrous oxide is given through a small
breathing mask which is placed over the child's nose, allowing them to relax but without putting t he child to sleep. As
soon as the mask is removed, the effects of the nitrous oxide go away within five minutes.

____

Conscious Sedation: Only used with additional verbal and written consent. Consists of an appropriate combination of
one or more sedative drugs. The goal is to achieve a mild sedation on your child. Your child will retain the ability to
breathe naturally and respond to verbal directions. It will be administered orally.

____

I.V. Sedation: Only used with additional verbal and written consent. Consists of the administration of sedation drugs
into the blood stream intravenously. The anesthesiologists does this in our office, while we complete all dental
treatment.

____

General Anesthesia: This is a medical procedure that renders the patient unconscious through the use of anesthetic
drugs. This is done at the hospital.

I hereby authorize Children’s Dentistry of Baytown to utilize the behavior management techniques listed on this form, if needed,
to assist in providing necessary dental treatment for my child. I hereby acknowledge that I have read and understand this
consent form, and that I have been given the opportunity to ask any questions I might have about the behavior management
techniques.
