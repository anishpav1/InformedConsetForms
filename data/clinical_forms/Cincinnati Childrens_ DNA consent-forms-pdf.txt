INFORMED CONSENT FOR DNA TESTING
PATIENT NAME:
DATE OF BIRTH:
I authorize the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center to analyze a sample of my/my child’s DNA for genetic testing for
______________________________________________________________.
(Specify disease)
The results of this test may be used to:
o Diagnose my/my child’s medical symptoms.
o Determine my/my child’s risk of developing a disease in the future.
o Determine my chance of passing on a genetic disease to my children.
The accuracy of genetic testing depends on the type of test ordered, the nature of the condition,
and the accuracy of the clinical information provided. No laboratory test, including DNA
testing, is 100% accurate. Given the limitations in current technology, it is possible that the test
will not work properly or that a diagnostic error may occur. It is my responsibility to discuss
with my physician the limitations of the testing that I am requesting.
In general:
o If the test detects an abnormality in the DNA, the test is >99% accurate.
o Rarely, an abnormality is found for which the clinical significance is not known.
o In other cases, the test is unable to identify an abnormality although the abnormality may
still exist. This event may be due to our current lack of knowledge of the complete gene
structure or an inability of the current technology to identify certain types of
abnormalities in the gene. As a result, a normal test result must be interpreted within the
limitations of the specific test.
o The test may reveal previously unrecognized biological relationships, such as
nonpaternity. DNA tests also may reveal a genetic condition in another family member.
Test results are confidential:
o Test results will be released to the referring physician or other health care provider as
specified on the test requisition.
o Test results will not be released to other individuals without my written consent.
o Test results may be part of my/ my child’s medical record and thus accessible to my
health insurance provider or other parties within legal limits.
After testing is complete:
o Any remaining sample will be stored in the Laboratory for two (2) years, after which
time the sample may be discarded.

The test and its limitations have been satisfactorily described to me. I acknowledge that I have
discussed the benefits, risks and limitations of this genetic test with my physician and/or other
health care professional. I understand some genetic tests can involve possible medical,
psychological or insurance issues for my family and me. I consent to genetic testing as described
above. I will receive a copy of this consent form for my records.
