MRI AND PREGNANCY
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF INFORMATION FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
(MRI) DURING PREGNANCY
I, the undersigned understand that I am pregnant or suspect that I am pregnant at the time of the
MRI exam.
There are no known biological risks from MRI. No delayed sequelae from MRI examination have
been encountered, and it is expected that the potential risk for any delayed sequelae is extremely
small or non-existent. However, according to the FDA, the safety of MRI procedures during
pregnancy has not been definitively proven and not recommended except in extraordinary
circumstances. I recognize these risks and recommendations.
After discussion with my personal physician, I agree to undergo this MRI examination with full
knowledge of the above information.
