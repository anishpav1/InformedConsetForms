TEETH TO BE EXTRACTED:
____________________________________________________________________________
Extraction of teeth is an irreversible process and, whether routine or difficult, is a surgical
procedure. As in any surgery, there are some risks. They include, but are not limited to, the
following:
________ 1. Swelling and/or bruising and discomfort in the surgery area.
________2. Stretching of the corners of the mouth resulting in cracking or bruising.
________3. Possible infection requiring additional treatment.
________4. Dry Socket- Jaw pain beginning a few days after surgery usually requiring additional
care. It is more common from lower extractions, especially wisdom teeth.
________5. Possible damage to adjacent teeth, especially those with large fillings or crowns
(caps).
________6. Numbness, pain, or altered sensations in the teeth, gums, lip, tongue (including
possible loss of taste sensation) and chin, due to the closeness of tooth roots (especially wisdom
teeth) to the nerves which can be bruised or damaged. Almost always sensation returns to
normal, but in rare cases, the loss may be permanent.
________7. Trismus- Limited jaw opening due to inflammation or swelling, most common after
wisdom tooth removal. Sometimes it is a result of Jaw Joint Disorder (TMJ), especially when TMJ
disease already exists.
________8. Bleeding- Significant bleeding is not common, but persistent oozing can be expected
for several hours
________9. Sharp ridges or bone splinters may form later at the edge of the socket. These
usually require another surgery to smooth or remove.
_______10. Incomplete removal of tooth fragments. To avoid injury to vital structures such as
nerves or sinus, sometimes small root tips may be left in place.
_______11. Sinus Involvement. The roots of the upper back teeth are often close to the sinus and
sometimes a piece of root can be displaced into the sinus or an opening may occur into the
mouth that may require additional care.
_______12. Jaw Fracture- While quite rare, it is possible in difficult or deeply impacted teeth.
