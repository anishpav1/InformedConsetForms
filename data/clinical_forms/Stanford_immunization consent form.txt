INFLUENZA VACCINE ADVERSE REACTIONS
Because influenza vaccine contains only non-infectious purified viral proteins, it cannot cause influenza. An occasional case of respiratory disease following
immunization represents coincidental illnesses unrelated to influenza immunization.
Local Symptoms: Slight tenderness, redness or hardening at the site of injection lasting for 1 to 2 days may occur in less than one third of recipients.
Systemic Symptoms: Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms occur infrequently and most often affect persons who have had no exposure
to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g., young children). These reactions generally begin 6 to 12 hours after immunization and can persist for 1 to 2
days. Immediate, presumable allergic reactions such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, or systemic anaphylaxis occur rarely after influenza immunization.
These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity reactions in people with severe egg allergy and such people should not be given influenza vaccine. This
includes people who develop hives, have swelling of the lips or tongue, or experience acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs. People with
documented immunoglobulin E (lgE)- mediated hypersensitivity to eggs, including those who have experienced occupational asthma or other allergic responses
from occupational exposure to egg protein, may also be at increased risk of reactions from influenza vaccine.
Unlike the 1976-1977 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent vaccine prepared from other virus strains has not been clearly associated with an increased frequency
of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Even if GBS were a true side effect, the very low estimated risk of GBS is less than that of severe influenza, which could be
prevented by vaccination. Other neurological disorders, including encephalopathies, have been temporarily associated with influenza immunizations, but cause
and effect has not been clearly established.
THE VACCINE SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED TO PEOPLE WITH ACUTE FEBRILE ILLNESSES UNTIL THEIR TEMPORARY SYMPTOMS HAVE ABATED.
HOWEVER, MINOR ILLNESSES WITH OR WITHOUT FEVER SHOULD NOT CONTRAINDICATE THE USE OF INFLUENZA VACCINE, PARTICULARLY
AMONG CHILDREN WITH A MILD UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION OR ALLERGIC RHINITIS. CONTRAINDICATIONS: INFLUENZA VIRUS IS
PROPAGATED IN EGGS FOR THE PREPARATION OF INFLUENZA VIRUS VACCINE; THUS, THIS VACCINE SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED TO
ANYONE WITH A HISTORY OF HYPERSENSITIVITY TO ANY COMPONENT OF THE VACCINE INCLUDING THIMEROSAL.

PNEUMONIA VACCINE ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common reactions that occur after receiving the pneumonia vaccine are a sore throat or tender arm with slight redness at the injection site.

CONSENT FOR SERVICES, MEDICAL RECORDS and HIPAA PRIVACY INFORMATION

I have read the adverse reactions associated with the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. A copy of the vaccine manufacturer’s drug information
sheet is available on request. Furthermore, I have also had an opportunity to ask questions about these immunizations. I believe the benefits outweigh
the risks and I voluntarily assume full responsibility for any reactions that may result. My medical record may be shared with my physician/insurance. I
am requesting that the immunization(s) be given to me or the person named below for whom I am the legal guardian. I, for myself, my heirs, executors,
personal representatives and assigns, hereby release Maxim, any retail site, grocery store, pharmacy, corporation, physician and/or medical director
and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions, directors, contractors, agents and employees, from any and all claims arising out of, in connection
with or in any way related to my receipt of this or these immunization(s). Maxim and the other aforementioned parties shall not at any time or to any
extent whatsoever be liable, responsible, or in any way accountable for any loss, injury, death or damage suffered or sustained by any person at any
time in connection with or as a result of this vaccine program or the administration of the vaccines described above.
Maxim will use and disclose your personal and health information to treat you, to receive payment for the care we provide, and for other health
care operations. Health care operations generally include those activities we perform to improve the quality of care. We have prepared a detailed
NOTICE OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY PRACTICES to help you better understand our policies in regards to your personal health
information. I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Notice of Privacy and Confidentiality Practices.
