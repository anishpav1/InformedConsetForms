“I have been advised to have the following radiographs (x-rays) taken as part of a
complete and thorough exam, in order to assist in thoroughly diagnosing oral or
dental diseases that may be present (some of which can be detected only with
radiographs):”
___________________________________
“I understand that by not having the recommended radiographs, conditions may
arise at any time in the future that could have been prevented, detected earlier,
and treated more successfully and less expensive if the radiographs were taken.
These conditions can include tooth decay, gum disease, infections, cysts, and
tumors. Not diagnosing them early could result in more pain and discomfort, more
expensive treatment, losing teeth that might otherwise be saved, and not
detecting growths until they are very large.”
“I am refusing to have these radiographs taken at this time. I therefore release Dr.
____________________ from any and all liability resulting from diseases or
pathology, now or in the future, that these radiographs might have revealed.”
