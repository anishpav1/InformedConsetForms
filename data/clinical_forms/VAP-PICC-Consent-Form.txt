PICC Consent
Procedure Information:
A Physician/Licensed Professional has ordered the insertion of a PICC. A Vascular Access Specialist from
Vascular Access Plus is a licensed nurse who is qualified to perform a PICC insertion procedure and will come
to the bedside and place the peripherally inserted vascular access device. The catheter is inserted into a vein
in your arm using ultrasound technology. A PICC catheter will extend from your upper arm to a large vessel in
the chest called the superior vena cava. The Vascular Access Plus nurse will use Magnetic imaging to view the
direction of the catheter and ECG tip technology to confirm PICC tip placement. A chest x-ray may be
performed to confirm PICC tip placement if you have a heart rhythm that cannot be analyzed by ECG.
