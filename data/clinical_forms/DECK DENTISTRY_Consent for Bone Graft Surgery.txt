DECK DENTISTRY | Consent for Bone Graft Surgery

1. I, _______________________________ have been informed and afforded the time to fully understand
Print Patient Name

the purpose and nature of the bone graft surgery procedure. I understand what is necessary to
accomplish the placement of the bone graft under the gum on/or in the bone.
2. My doctor has carefully examined my mouth. Alternatives to this treatment have been
explained. I have tried or considered these methods, but desire a bone graft to help secure the
replaced missing teeth.
3. I have further been informed of the possible risks and complications involved with surgery,
drugs and anesthesia. Such complications include pain, swelling, infection and discoloration.
Numbness of the lip, tongue, chin, cheek or teeth may occur. The exact duration may not be
determinable and may be irreversible. Also possible are thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the
vein), injury to teeth present, bone fractures, sinus penetration, delayed healing, allergic
reactions to drugs or medications used, etc.
4. I understand that if nothing is done any of the following could occur: bone disease, loss of
bone, gum tissue inflammation, infection, sensitivity or looseness of teeth followed by necessity
of extraction. Also possible are temporomandibular joint (jaw) problems, headaches or
referred pains to back of the neck and facial muscles and tired muscles when chewing.
In addition, I am aware that if nothing is done, an inability to place a bone graft or implants
at a later date due to changes in oral or medical conditions could exist.
5. My doctor has explained that there is no method to predict accurately the gum and bone
healing capabilities in each patient following the placement of a bone graft. It has been
explained that bone in its healing process remodels and there is no method to predict the final
volume of bone, thus additional grafting may be necessary.
6. It has been explained that in some instances bone grafts fail (mal-union, delayed union, or
non-union of the donor bone graft to the recipient bone site) and must be removed. It has also
been explained to me lack of adequate bone growth into the bone graft replacement material
could result in failure. I have been informed and understand that the practice of dentistry is not
an exact science; no guarantees or assurances as to the outcome of the results of treatment or
surgery can be made. I am aware that there is a risk that the bone graft surgery may fail, which
might require further corrective surgery or the removal of the bone graft with possible
corrective surgery associated with the removal. If the bone graft surgery fails I understand that
alternative prosthetic measures may have to be considered.
7. I understand that excessive smoking, alcohol or blood sugar may effect gum healing and may
limit the success of the bone graft. I agree to follow my doctors home care instructions.
I agree to report t o my doctor for regular examinations as instructed.

9. I agree to the type of anesthesia, depending on the choice of the Doctor. I agree not to operate
a motor vehicle or hazardous device for at least 24 hours or more or until fully recovered from
the effects of the anesthesia or drugs given for my care.
10. To my knowledge, I have given an accurate report of my physical and mental health history.
I have also reported any prior allergic or unusual reactions to drugs, food, insect bites,
anesthetics, pollens, dust, blood or body diseases, gum or skin reactions, abnormal bleeding
or any other conditions related to my health.

11. I consent to photography, filming, recording, x-rays and additional professional staff observing
the procedure to be performed for the advancement of implant dentistry, providing my identity
is not revealed.
12. I agree to notify the doctor’s office of any and all changes to my address and/or telephone
number within a reasonable time frame (two to four weeks)
13. I request and authorize medical/dental services for myself, including bone grafts and other
surgery. I fully understand the contemplated procedure, surgery or treatment conditions that
may become apparent, which warrant, in the judgment of the doctor, additional or alternative
treatment pertinent to the success of comprehensive treatment. I also approve any
modifications in design, materials or care, if it is felt this is for my best interest.
If an unforeseen condition arises in the course of treatment which calls for performance of
procedures in addition to or different from that now contemplated, I further authorize and
direct my doctor, associate or assistant, to do whatever they deem necessary and advisable
under the circumstances, including the decision not to proceed with the bone graft procedure.
