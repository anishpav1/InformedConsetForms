Pre—Oxytocin Checklist for Women with Term—Singleton Babies

This Pre—Oxytocin checklist represents a guideline for care; however, individualized medical care is directed
by the physician.

If the following checklist cannot be completed, Oxytocin should not be initiated. If Oxytocin is
stopped, the Pre—Oxytocin Checklist will be reviewed before Oxytocin is re—initiated.

Date and time completed RN Signature

 

1. _ Physician Order on chart

2 _ OB Physical & History Short Form completed (for elective induction)

3 _ Prenatal Record on chart*

4. _ Indication for induction is documented

5 _ Pelvis is documented by physician to be clinically adequate (should be on prenatal record)*

6 _ Estimated fetal weight within past week (clinical or ultrasound) less than 4500 grams in a non—diabetic woman or less
than 4250 grams in a diabetic woman.* It not available, measure fundal height. If fundal height is greater than 40

centimeters notify physician.

7. _ Gestational age documented

8. _ Verify signed informed consent for Vaginal Delivery and Possible Episiotomy.

9. _ Verify signed informed consent for Induction or Augmentation

10. _ Physician with C—section privileges is aware of the induction and readily available

11. _ Status of cervix is assessed and documented

12. _ Presentation is assessed and documented (Physician is required to come in if nurse unable to determine)
13. _ Fetal assessment completed and indicates: (Complete all below)

a. A minimum of 30 minutes of fetal monitoring is required prior to starting Oxytocin

b. Presence of 2 accelerations (15 bpm X 15 sec) within 30 minutes, or moderate variability, or a biophysical profile of
6 out of 10 present.

0. No late decelerations in the last 30 minutes

d. No more than 2 variable decelerations exceeding 60 seconds and decreasing greater than 60 bpm from the

baseline within previous 30 minutes prior to starting Oxytocin infusion

*May be delayed for non—elective admissions

”There will be some indications in which alteration in management from that described in the protocol are clinically appropriate.

If, after reviewing the fetal heart rate strip and course of labor the responsible physician feels that in his or her judgement,
continued use of Oxytocin is in the best interest of the mother and baby, the physician should document the indication for deviating
from protocol and order the Oxytocin to continue.

You are scheduled for an induction of labor on (date) at (time).
The reason for your scheduled induction Is
The goal of induction of labor Is to achieve vaginal delivery by starting uterine contractions before the spontaneous
start of labor. Elective induction of labor (scheduled induction without a medical indication) may not be done until you
are at least 39 weeks. This is important so that your newborn does not have complications due to possible

 

 

prematurity.
Fetal Maturity Criteria (Please complete for elective inductions)
Final EDC as confirmed by D LMP D Ultrasound

D Fetal heart tones have been documented for 20 weeks by non—electronic fetoscope or for 30 weeks by doppler.

D 36 weeks have passed since a positive serum or urine HCG pregnancy was confirmed

D An ultrasound measurement of the crown—rump length, obtained between 6—11 weeks, supports a gestational
age of at least 39 weeks.

D An ultrasound scan, obtained at 12—20 weeks, confirms a gestational age of 39 weeks or more determined by
clinical history and physical exam

D 37 weeks have elapsed post—ovulation documented by ovulation predictor or since fertilization

Your cervical exam today is centimeters dilated and °/o effaced. The Bishop score is a scoring

system based on your cervical exam and your score today is . When the Bishop score is 7 or more, the

likelihood that you will have a vaginal birth is the same as that of natural labor. Induction of labor with a low Bishop

score has been associated with failure of induction, prolonged labor, and a high cesarean section rate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bishop Score (must be completed for all inductions): Pelvis Adequate CI Yes CI No
Factor 0 1 2 3
Dilatation Closed 1—20m 3—4cm 50m or more
Effacement 0—30°/o 40—50% 60—70% 80% or more
Station —3 —2 —1/0 +1/+2
Consistency Firm Medium Soft ———
Position Posterior Mid Anterior ———

 

 

 

 

 

If your Bishop score is low, your cervix is not "favorable" for induction. Your Physician may recommend a form of
cervical ripening:

D Misoprostol or Dinoprostone (Cervidil): this is a medicine placed in the vagina to make the cervix favorable.
Sometimes, it also starts labor. Oxytocin (Pitocin) will be started at a low dose and gradually increased until you
have regular, painful contractions. The side effects are related to the amount given and can result in too many
contractions in a short time (hyperstimulation) that may cause a temporary drop in the baby’s heart beat. Rarely,
hyperstimulation can lead to early separation of the placenta or afterbirth (abrouptio placentae) or rupture of the
uterus. If hyperstimulation occurs, the Pitocin may be temporarily stopped until contractions have slowed down and
the baby’s heart beat has returned to normal.

The alternative to induction of labor is to wait for labor to start spontaneously. I understand the risks and benefits of
this procedure and wish to proceed.

Division: Department Manual: Women’s Services Page #: 1 0f 4

Manuals

Origination Date: 5/1996 Revised Date: 7/2011 Reviewed Date: 7/2011
PURPOSE

To provide a guideline for the use of prostaglandin agents when used to initiate labor or effect
physical softening and distensibility 0f the cervix (cervical ripening) in preparation for labor and
birth.

POLICY
1. Cervical ripening is recommended for patients undergoing an induction with a Bishop
Score of less than 8.
2. Cervical ripening may be carried out by the LDRP Registered Nurse (RN) with the
written order of a physician.
3. The patient must have an informed consent for an induction of labor provided by
her physician and documented in the prenatal record or admission progress note.
4. The following should be assessed and documented in the Chart prior to initiating
induction by administration of a cervical ripening agent:
a. Indication for Induction
b. Bishop Score
C. Fetal presentation
5. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (external or internal) is required.

INDICATIONS
Indications for Induction/Augmentation include:
1. Vascular diseases that are life threatening to the mother or infant in her second or third
trimester.
Preeclampsia
Rh incompatibility
Diabetes
Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM)
Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pPROM)
Chorioamnionitis
Term pregnancy greater than 39 weeks with a favorable cervix
Biophysical profile less than 6 or Oligohydramnios
10. Uterine dystocia— Poor quality contractions that do not produce cervical Change.
11. Prevention of prolonged labor
12. Post Dates greater than 41 weeks gestation

©waom5ww

CONTRAINDICATIONS
1. Contraindications for cervical ripening, induction or augmentation of labor are the same
as those for any contraindication to a vaginal delivery.

2. Use of Prostaglandins for cervical ripening in patients with a previous cesarean section
is not recommended. (ACOG, 2004, 2006b, 2009)

 

 

 

Policy Name: Cervical Ripening for a Viable Fetus Using Page #: 2 0f 4
Cervadil or Misoprostol

 

 

CONSIDERATIONS
For elective delivery at 39 completed weeks the following criteria must be met:

1.

2.

3.

Fetal heart tones have been documented for 20 weeks by non-electronic fetoscope or
for 30 weeks by Doppler.

It has been 36 weeks since a serum or urine human Chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy
test was found to be positive by a reliable laboratory.

Ultrasound measurement of the crown-rump length at 6-11 weeks of gestation supports
a gestational age equal to or greater than 39 weeks.

Ultrasound measurement at 12-20 weeks of gestation supports a Clinically determined
gestational age of 39 weeks or greater.

F01 elective delivery at less than 39 completed weeks of gestation, and none of the
above criteria are met, fetal pulmonary maturity should be confirmed by amniocentesis.

DINOPROS T ONE (CERVADIL) —a prostaglandin preparation used to ripen the cervix.

CONSIDERATIONS
1. Oxytocin and Cervadil are not to be administered concurrently.
2. Cervadil attenuates the contractile response to Oxytocin therefore administration of

Oxytocin should be delayed for 30 minutes after removal of cervadil insert.

3. Cervadil can cause tachysystole.
4. How prepared: Dinoprostone (Cervadil) 10 mG vaginal insert

EQUIPMENT

1. Sterile gloves

2. Cervadil insert

3. Lubricant

PROCEDURE

1. Ensure patient has had informed consent from her physician with documentation in the
prenatal record or admission progress note.

2. Obtain patient’s wn'tten consent.

3. Explain procedure to patient.

4. Apply continuous Fetal Monitor to asses Uterine Activity and assure Category I FHR
pattern prior to insertion of Cervadil.

5. Obtain Cervadil from pharmacy.

6. Assist patient to empty bladder.

7. Vital signs before insertion and 15 minutes after insertion, then routine as for laboring
patient.

8. Registered Nurse to insert Cervadil by positioning the insert between the index and
middle ﬁngers. Place it transversely in the posterior fornix of the vagina with its long
axis transverse to the long axis of the vagina. Ensure cord remains attached to
Cervadil disk and long end protrudes from introitus to facilitate removal.

9. Remove Cervadil for the following:

a. For Tachysystole accompanied by FHR Category II or Category 111.
b. After 12 hours
C. Upon onset of active labor

 

 

 

Policy Name: Cervical Ripening for a Viable Fetus Using Page #: 3 0f 4
Cervadil or Misoprostol

 

 

d. Oxytocin may be started 30 minutes after removal of Cervadil.

MISOPROSTOL (CYTOTEC) — a prostaglandin preparation used for the purpose of cervical
ripening prior to, and for induction of labor.

INDICATIONS
The same as for any induction.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

1. The same as those for any induction.

2. Additional contraindications for the use of misoprostol include:
Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin compound.
Clinically significant asthma.

Heart disease.

Frequent uterine contractions (more than 13 per hour).
Multiple gestation.

Absence of a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing.
Polyhydramnios

Patient refusal.

.5610 rm 11.0 9‘1»

CONSIDERATIONS

1. Oxytocin and Misoprostol are not to be administered concurrently.

2. Plasma concentrations of Misoprostol rise gradually and decline slowly. Therefore
Oxytocin administration may be initiated no sooner than 4 hours after last dose of
Misoprostol.

3. Misoprosol can cause tachysystole.

4. How prepared: Misoprostol (Cytotek) 25 microgram (1/4 tablet of 100 microgram

tablet).

PROCEDURE
1. Ensure patient has had informed consent from her physician with documentation in the
prenatal record or admission progress note.
2. Prepare equipment and obtain 25 micrograms of Misoprostol.
3. Perform vaginal examination and Leopold’s maneuvers to determine presentation and
lie.
Prepare patient for insertion and explain procedure.
Perform baseline assessment.
Record temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure.
Apply continuous Fetal Monitor to asses Uterine Activity and assure Category I FHR
pattern prior to Misoprostol administration.
8. LDRP RN may place Misoprostol in the posterior fornix of the vagina every 4 hours to
a maximum of 6 doses.
9. Re-dosing is withheld if:
a. The patient has 3 or more uterine contractions in a 10-minute period.
b. Adequate cervical ripening is achieved (Bishop Score is >9 or cervical
examination shows dilation greater than 3 centimeters and effacement > 80%.

C. Fetal heart rate tracing is Category 1101 Category III.

MONITORING
1. Continuous monitoring of FHR and Uterine Activity is required.
2. Ensure patient remains in the supine position using a hip wedge, for 30-minutes after
each dose.
3. After initial 30 minutes, the patient may ambulate with continuous fetal monitoring.

Your doctor may recommend the use of a medication called Oxytocin (Pitocin) to increase the amount and/or strength
of your contractions. This is called "Augmentation" and is used when your contractions do not result in continuing
cervical dilation or movement downward (descent) of your baby.

Your current cervical exam is cm dilated and % effaced.

Your baby’s head is at station.

Station tells you the location of your baby on its way down the birth canal. Negative numbers mean the baby is higher
in the pelvis, positive means lower in the pelvis.

Oxytocin (Pitocin) will be started at a low dose and gradually increased until you have regular contractions. These
contractions should be stronger than the ones you will be having and therefore should be more effective in causing
further dilation. The side effects are related to the amount given; therefore the dose is Closely monitored by your nurse
and physician. If there are too many contractions in a short time (hyperstimulation), a temporary drop in the baby’s
heartbeat may occur. If hyperstimulation occurs and heartbeat drops, the Pitocin will be stopped until the contractions
have slowed down and the baby’s heartbeat has returned to normal. Rarely, hyperstimulation can lead to early
separation of the placenta 0r afterbirth (abruptio placentae) or rupture of the uterus; either of these complications would
require a Cesarean Section.

The alternative to Pitocin augmentation is to continue labor without assistance. There are risks to prolonged or
ineffective labor thatlinclude: .

0 Increased r1sk 0f 1nfect10n 1n your baby 0 Increased rigk of infection in you

0 Hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) 0 Increased need for Cesarean Section

My doctor has explained these risks and benefits; I understand and wish to proceed with augmentation.

Su médico esta recomendando el uso de un medicamento denominado oxitocina (Pitocin) para aumentar la cantidad y/0
1ntens1dad de las contracc10nes. Eso se conoce como "1nducc16n de contracc10nes uter1nas" y se usa cuando las
contracc10nes n0 dan lugar a contracc10nes cerV1cales cont1nuas n1 al dezplazam1ent0 decendente (hac1a abajo) de su
bebé.

Su examen cervical actual indica cm de dilatacién y un % de borramiento del cuello uterino.
La cabeza de su bebé se encuentra en la estacién

Las estaciones indican la ubicacién del bebé en V1as del part0. Un numero negativo significa que el bebé se encuentra
mas arriba en la pelVis y un0 positiVO que se encuentra mas abajo.

Se comenzara a administrar oxitocina (Pitocin) a una dosis baja y se aumentara gradualmente hasta que presente
contracciones regulares. Estas contracciones deben ser mas intensas de las que tiene acutalmente y por lo tanto deben
ser mas eficaces en producir una mayor dilatacién. Los efectos secundarios estan asociados con la cantidad de
medicamento administrado; por lo tanto, su enfermera y médico daran seguimiento estrecho a las dosis. Si se producen
demasiadas contracciones durante un perfodo breve (hiperestimulacién), puede ocurrir un descenso temporal en los
latidos del corazén de su bebé. Si ocurre hiperestimulacién y se reducen 10s latidos cardiacos, se suspendera el uso de
Pitocin hasta que disminuyan las contracciones y los latidos del bebé se normalicen. En raras ocasiones la
hiperestimulatién puede causar la separacién prematura de la prematura de la placenta 0 expulsién de secundinas
(abrupcién placentaria) 0 desgarramiento del utero. Estas complicaciones requieren practicar part0 por cesarea.

La alternativa a la induccién con de contracciones uterinas con Pitocin es seguir con el trabajo de part0 sin ayuda. Hay
riesgos asociados con un trabajo de part0 prolongado 0 ineficaz, por ejemplo:

0 Mayor riesgo de infeccién para el bebé 0 Mayor riesgo de infeccién para usted

o Hemorragia (sangrado excesivo) 0 Mayor necesidad de un part0 por cesarea

Mi médico me ha explicado estos riesgos y beneficios. Entiendo 10s mismos y deseo proceder con el procedimiento de
1nducc16n de contracc10nes uter1nas.

Division: Department Manuals Manual: Women’s Services Page #: 1 0f 5
Origination Date: 10/2008 Revised Date: 4/2012 Reviewed Date: 4/2012
PURPOSE

To provide guidelines for the care of a woman undergoing an induction or augmentation of
labor. The goal of induction of labor is to achieve vaginal delivery by stimulating uterine
contractions before the spontaneous onset of labor. The goal of augmentation of labor is to
enhance inadequate uterine contractions.

POLICY

Intravenous oxytocin (Pitocin) as ordered by the physician and clinically and or
psychosocially indicated may be used to induce or augment uterine contractions
providing the following criteria are met:

A. Personnel who are familiar with the effects of oxytocin and able to identify both
maternal and fetal complications will be in attendance during the administration
of oxytocin.

B. The patient’s prenatal record will be on the patient’s chart before the induction

is started to confirm gestational age of 39 weeks for non-medically or clinically
indicated inductions.
C. Once the infusion is started, the physician must be readily available to manage
any complications, including an emergency cesarean delivery. ACOG(1999)
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Generally, the contraindications to labor inductions are the same as those for spontaneous
labor and vaginal delivery. They include, but are not limited to, the following situations:

A. Vasa previa or complete placenta previa

B. Unfavorable fetal positions or presentations which are undeliverable without
conversion priorto delivery i.e. transverse lie.

C. Umbilical cord prolapse

D. Previous transfundal uterine surgery ACOG(1999)

EQUIPMENT

Electronic Fetal Monitor

Primary IV solution per physician order

IV with Oxytocin as ordered by physician per preprinted Induction/Augmentation
Physician Orders

Automatic infusion pumps

Sterile exam gloves

mp 05>

PROCEDURE
1. Complete assessment to obtain baseline values of mother and fetus as follows:

A. Determine baseline blood pressure, pulse, respirations and temperature on
mother.

B. Determine baseline fetal heart rate via electronic continuous fetal monitoring,
documenting baseline FHR, and variability, the presence of periodic or episodic
accelerations and decelerations and uterine contraction pattern. Monitor for a
minimum of 30 minutes to assess fetal well being.

Review the patient’s chart for induction indications, medical and nursing assessment
of fetaI/maternal status and clarity of physician’s orders.

Complete the pre-Oxytocin checklist and document in the electronic medical record.
(See Addendum)

Verify informed consent for induction or augmentation of labor.
Confirm gestational age.

Immediately priorto starting the Oxytocin infusion, a pelvic examination ofthe patient
is done by the physician or competent RN. For a Bishop Score of less than 7, contact
physician for orders / contraindications for cervical ripening agent.

Insert intravenous catheter and begin infusion of main-Iine IV solution as ordered by
Physician.

Use Premixed infusion obtained from Medication Administration System: 20 units
Oxytocin in 1000 ml 0.9% Normal Saline Solution and connect to IV tubing without
injection ports.

Obtain electronic infusion pump.

Label tubing with Oxytocin label at point of insertion site and at pump. Connect
Oxytocin infusion at port closest to insertion site.

Start Oxytocin at 2 milliunits/minute via infusion pump as ordered per preprinted
Induction/Augmentation Physician Orders

Place the patient on strict intake and output monitoring.
Maintain the induction as follows:

A. The fetal heart rate and contraction pattern will be evaluated and documented
as follows:
1. When starting Oxytocin infusion
2. 15 minutes after initiating infusion and after any rate adjustments

(increase or decrease)

3. Q 30 minutes during maintenance

B. For a Category III fetal heart rate tracing, discontinue Oxytocin and initiate
intrauterine resuscitation measures as indicated. Contact primary physician
immediately.

C. For Tachysystole (a uterine contraction pattern of more than 5 UCs in a 10
minute window) perform the following interventions:

1. Category] Tracing — reposition to lateral recumbent and administer 500 mL
IV bolus of mainline fluid and observe for 15 minutes. If Tachysystole
unresolved 15 minutes after intervention, decrease Oxytocin rate by 1/2 and
observe for additional 15 minutes. If Tachysystole unresolved after 30
minutes, discontinue Oxytocin and notify primary physician.

2. Category II tracing: Recurrent variable or late decelerations with moderate
variability— Reduce Oxytocin infusion rate by 1/2, reposition patient to lateral
recumbent and give 500 mL IV bolus of mainline fluid. Observe for 15
minutes. If no improvement, discontinue Oxytocin infusion and notify
primary physician.

3. Category II tracing: recurrent variable or late decelerations with minimal
variability— Discontinue Oxytocin, reposition to lateral recumbent,
administer 500 mL IV bolus of mainline fluid and observe for 15 minutes.
Consider administration of oxygen and/or tocolytic mediation (Terbutaline
0.25 mG SQ X 1)

4. When Tachysystole resolves:

a. If Oxytocin has been off less than 30 minutes, restart at 1/2 the rate when
discontinued.

b. If Oxytocin has been off longerthan 30 minutes, restart at 2
milliunits/minute and increase per induction/augmentation physician
orders.

D. Maternal blood pressure and pulse will be monitored and recorded q 30
minutes.

E. Advance to next dosage level per L&D Oxytocin Department Order Set every
30 minutes until adequate labor as uterine activity indicates, not to exceed 2
mU/min (12 mI/hr) every 30 minutes and to a maximum dose of 20 mU/min
(120mI/hr.)

F. When 20 mU/min. has been reached if patient is not in labor as evidenced by
cervical change, notify physician and when ordered by physician, Oxytocin
infusion may be increased beyond 20 mU/ min but must have an IUPC in
place.).

G. Once an effective contraction pattern is established (5 contractions or less in 10
minutes, lasting 90 seconds or less, and moderate in strength as indicated by
palpation or 50-70mmHg via IUPC) hold the oxytocin at that rate or decrease
the infusion and determine ifa regular contraction pattern will be maintained.

XII. OXYTOCIN INFUSION RATE GUIDE

The following guide for infusing Oxytocin to induce or augment labor may be used for
a solution of 20 units Oxytocin in 1000 mL of IV fluid. This mixture gives 20 milliunits
