Informed Consent for DNA Testing

I, __________________________________________, request DNA-based testing for [circle] MYSELF and/or
MY CHILD for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) / Familial Isolated Hyperparathyroidism
(FIHP) / MEN1 gene (name of diseases/gene). I understand that more information about MEN1 and FIHP is
available from my health care provider and can also be found in the MEN1/FIHP Information Sheet on the
GeneDx website (www.genedx.com).
I understand that biological samples will be removed using standard techniques that carry very little risk. In
addition, if prenatal diagnosis is being performed, fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling or
amniocentesis will be used. I understand that the samples will be used for the purpose of attempting to
determine if I and/or members of my family are carriers of the disease gene, or are affected with, or at
increased risk to someday be affected with this genetic disease. I hereby give permission to collect biological
samples for this test from the minor children listed below:

I understand that:
1. The methods used by GeneDx are expected to be greater than 99% sensitive in detecting mutations
identifiable by sequencing. The DNA test may be unable to identify an abnormality that is present due to
our current lack of knowledge of the complete gene structure or an inability of the current technology to
identify certain types of changes (mutations) in the gene.
Sequence analysis of the MEN1 coding region detects a mutation in approximately 75-90% of individuals
with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I and 23-57% of patients with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism
diagnosed on the basis of clinical features.
Large deletions of the MEN1 gene, which have been found in approximately 1-8% of familial MEN1
patients, will not be detected by sequencing. If a mutation is not detected by sequencing, MLPA is available
as a separate test to evaluate for a deletion of one or more exons of the MEN1 gene.
I have been informed of the likelihood of finding a mutation in the gene for which I am being tested
and have received test-specific information. ______ (Initials)
2. An error in the diagnosis of disease status may occur if the true biological relationships of the family
members being tested are not as I have stated. For example, non-paternity means that the stated father of
an individual is not the true biological father. This test may detect non-paternity, and it may be necessary to
report this finding to the individual who requested testing. Any erroneous diagnosis in a family member can
lead to an incorrect diagnosis for other related individuals who are being tested.
3. I understand that the DNA analysis performed by GeneDx is specific for this disease and in no way
guarantees my health or the health of my living or unborn children.

4. In order to perform accurate prenatal diagnosis on a fetal sample, biological samples are also required
from the affected individual in the family, the mother, and in some cases the father.
5. I understand that my sample is not being banked at GeneDx. DNA samples are not returned to individuals
or to referring physicians. However, in some cases if further diagnostic tests are needed, a referring
physician may request in writing that additional tests be performed on an existing DNA sample (additional
costs apply). Additional testing will not be performed unless requested by an authorized healthcare
professional.
6. DNA samples may be kept by the laboratory for up to 25 years. DNA samples may be available for
additional diagnostic testing as indicated above and may be used for internal laboratory quality assurance
purposes. In some cases, anonymized DNA may be used by the laboratory for new test development after
all identifiers have been removed. ______ (Initials)
NEW YORK STATE ONLY:
I consent to having my DNA sample retained for greater than 60 days after the completion of the testing.
PLEASE INITIAL: ______
7. Because of the complexity of DNA based testing and the important implications of the test results, results
will only be reported to me through a physician, genetic counselor, certified genetics professional or other
professionals as entitled by law. The result reports are confidential and will only be released to other
medical professionals or other parties with my express written consent. All laboratory data is confidential
and will not be released from GeneDx. Participation in DNA testing is completely voluntary.

8. I will receive a copy of this consent form.
By my signature below, I attest to the following:
1. I have read and understand the information provided on this form.
2. I understand that I may request genetic counseling PRIOR to having this test, and genetic
counseling is also available after the test has been completed..

Health Care Provider’s Statement: By my signature below, I indicate that I am the referring physician or
authorized health care provider. I have explained the purpose of the test described above. The patient has
been given the opportunity to ask questions and/or seek genetic counseling. The patient has voluntarily
decided to have the test performed by GeneDx.
