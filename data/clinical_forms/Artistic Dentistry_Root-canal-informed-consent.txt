INFORMED CONSTENT FOR ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
TOOTH/TEETH NUMBERS______________________________
I have been made aware of my condition of tooth/teeth requiring endodontic (root
canal) treatment in the opinion of my dentist. I am aware that the practice of
dentistry is not an exact science, and no guarantees have been made to me
concerning the results of the procedure.
I understand that an alternative treatment might be (but not limited to) extraction
of the involved tooth or teeth.
I understand that the consequences of doing nothing might be worsening of the
condition, further infection, cystic formation, swelling, pain, loss of tooth, and/or
other systemic diseases problems.
Some complications of root canal treatment may be, but are not limited to:
A. Failure of the procedure necessitation re-treatment, root surgery, or
extraction.
B. Post-operative pain, swelling, bruising, and/or restricted jaw opening that
may
persist for several days or longer.
C. Breakage of an instrument inside the canal during treatment, which may be
left
as it, or may require surgical removal.
D. Perforation of the canal with instruments which may require additional
surgical
treatment or result in the loss of the tooth.
E. Damage to sinuses or nerves resulting in temporary or possibly permanent
numbness or tingling of lip, chin, tongue, or other areas.
Some of these complications may require additional surgical treatment by a
specialist and the cost of which is my responsibility. Successful completion of the
root canal procedure does not prevent future decay or fracture.
I understand that in order to achieve the most optimal and predictable results, I
need to complete the entire root canal procedure, which may take more than two
visits. If I do not complete the entire root canal procedure within the amount of
time that my dentist has recommended, I understand that the root canal may fail,
and the tooth needs to be re-treated or extracted.

An endodontically treated tooth will become more brittle and may discolor. In most
cases a full crown with build-up is recommended after treatment to lessen the
chances of fracture.
I understand the recommended treatment, the risks of such treatment, any
alternatives including the consequences of doing nothing. Fee(s) involved have also
been explained to me, and I have had a chance to have all of my questions
answered.
I understand it is my responsibility to notify this office should any undue or
unexpected problems occur or if I experience any problems relating to the
treatment rendered or the services performed.
INFORMED CONSENT: I have been given the opportunity to ask any questions
regarding the nature and purpose of root canal treatment and have received
answers to my satisfaction. I do voluntarily assume any and all possible risks,
including risks of substantial harm, if any, which may be associated with any phase
of this treatment in hopes of obtaining the desired and/or any satisfactory results.
By signing this form, I am freely giving my consent to authorize Dr. Peter Vanstrom
and/or Dr. Anna Refai in rendering any services he/she deems necessary or
advisable to treatment of my dental conditions, including the administration and/or
prescribing of any anesthetic and/or medications.
