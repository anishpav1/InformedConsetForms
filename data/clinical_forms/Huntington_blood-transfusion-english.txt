CONDITION: You have a medical problem for which you are undergoing treatment. In the course of your treatment, it may

concerning this procedure and, if signed by you, authorizes the transfusion of blood or blood components.
RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND TO CONSENT: You have the right to receive information concerning your
medical condition and any proposed transfusion. You also have the right either to consent to or refuse any transfusion of blood or
blood components. Along with this consent form, you will receive a brochure, A Patient's Guide to Blood Transfusions. This
brochure contains information concerning the benefits and risks of the various options for blood transfusions, including
predonation by yourself or others. You should discuss with your physician any questions you may have about transfusions.
RISKS: All medical procedures carry some degree of risk, and transfusions are no exception. The risks of transfusions of blood
or blood components include both minor and serious reactions to the blood or blood components, and complications resulting
from the transfusion. There is also a risk of transmission of diseases such as hepatitis, the AIDS virus, or other blood transmittable
diseases. All donated blood is carefully screened and matched, but there is no guarantee against these risks.

alternative to blood transfusion. However, if you have any further questions on this matter, you should discuss them with your
physician at this time.
