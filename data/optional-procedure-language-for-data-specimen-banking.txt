Use this language as an insert into one of the consent templates with HIPAA authorization.  Banking of specimens/data is usually an optional procedure; it should appear either 1) as an optional procedure with opt-in/opt-out choices in the main body of the consent (in the compound HIPAA template), or 2) as an optional procedure with opt-in/opt-out choices in the Optional Additional Procedures section (separate HIPAA template).  If the sole purpose of the study is to bank specimens and/or data, then the following language should be included the main body of the consent without opt-in/opt-out choices.

Please edit all of the highlighted references to make sure they accurately describe what types of information/samples your study is planning to bank. 

Optional Consent for Data and Specimen Banking for Future Research

_<Insert company or physician name>__ would like to keep some of the data, blood and tissue that is taken during the study but is not used for other tests. If you agree, the data and samples will be kept and may be used in future research to learn more about _<insert name of disease>_. The research that is done with your data and samples is not designed to specifically help you. It might help people who have _<insert name of disease> and other diseases in the future. Reports about research done with your data and samples will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health records. The research using your data and samples will not affect your care.

The choice to let _<company or physician> _ keep the data and samples for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect the care that you will receive as part of the study. If you decide now that your data and samples can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any time and contact your study doctor to let him or her know that you do not want  <company or physician> _ to use your data and samples any longer, and they will no longer be used for research. Otherwise, they may be kept until they are used up, or until _ <company or physician> _ decides to destroy them. 

When your data and samples are given to other researchers in the future,  <company or physician>  will not give them your name, address, phone number or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. 

Sometimes data and samples are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your data and samples are used for this kind of research, the results will not be told to you and will not be put in your health records. Your data and samples will only be used for research and will not be sold. The research done with your data and samples may help to develop new products in the future, but there is no plan for you to be paid.

The possible benefits of research from your data and samples include learning more about what causes _<disease>_ and other diseases, how to prevent them and how to treat them. The greatest risk to you is the release of your private information.  <company or physician>__ will protect your records so that your name, address and phone number will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. There will be no cost to you for any data or sample collection and storage by <company or physician> .


Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, circle "yes" or "no." If you have questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse. Remember, no matter what you decide to do about the storage and future use of your data and samples, you may still take part in the study.
