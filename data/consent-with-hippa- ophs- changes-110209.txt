CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE
IN A CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY AND AUTHORIZATION TO USE PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
TITLE OF STUDY:				As on Application 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:		Name, Title, and Department

"You" refers to "You" or "Your Child" throughout this document unless the study involves a baby/newborn child.  If so, be sure that research procedures described below use terms such as "to your baby/newborn" as appropriate

INTRODUCTION[A1]:  We would like to invite you to be part of a research study at Children's National Medical Center.  Before you decide if you would like to participate, we want you to know why we are doing the study.  We also want you to know about any risks (anything unexpected that might happen) and what you will be expected to do in the study. 

This form gives you information about the study.  Your doctor will talk to you about the study and answer any questions you have.  We encourage you to discuss this study with your family and anyone else you trust before making your decision.  We will ask you to sign this form to show that you understand the study.  If your child is seven years old or older, we may talk to your child about the study and ask your child to sign a form like this one but shorter.  We will give you a copy of this form to keep.  It is important that you know:  
* You do not have to join the study;
* You may change your mind and stop being in the study any time you want.  In some cases however, stopping the study medication early may cause harm to you.  Your doctor will discuss this with you. PLEASE DELETE THIS BULLET IF THE STATEMENT DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS RESEARCH
* If we make any important change to the study we will tell you about it and make sure you still want to be in the study.

A. PURPOSE OF STUDY
1. Explain the purpose of the research study
2. Explain why the participant qualifies for the study. *Always refer to study
           patients as "participants" throughout this document.

[Sample:  We want to see if a drug called ribavirin helps in the treatment of children with hepatitis C.  We now use a drug called interferon to treat hepatitis C.  Interferon is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to use in children.  Ribavirin is an experimental drug for children because it has not been tested on children.  In tests on adults, using interferon and ribavirin together works better than using interferon alone.  We want to see if using interferon and ribavirin together works better for children too.  We also want to find out what amount of ribavirin works best with interferon.  
Your child is being asked to be in the study because your child has had hepatitis C for more than a year.] 

B. PROCEDURE
1. Briefly explain the study design and treatment methods.  Discuss clinical detail only as relevant to consent (i.e., to the risks, benefits, or burdens of the study).
2. Identify what is experimental about the study.
3. Specify the number of required inpatient or outpatient visits, other time commitments, number of venipunctures, amount of blood to be drawn (in household measures), tests, exams, interviews, other burdens, etc.
4. Explain how the treatment groups will be assigned.  Explain randomization in lay terms.  If the study is placebo controlled, participants must be informed that there is a possibility that they will receive 'no treatment,' and the consequences of no treatment or withholding previous treatment regimen should be discussed.
5. Distinguish the procedures that are standard clinical care from those which are purely for research.

[Sample:  We will divide the children in the study randomly into three groups (like flipping a coin, so your child has an equal chance of being in any group).  We will give all three groups interferon.  Interferon is the standard drug used for children with hepatitis C. We will give one of the groups a small amount of ribavirin.  We will give one of the groups a larger amount of ribavirin.  We will give the last group the largest amount of ribavirin.  You should know that in adults, the largest amount of ribavirin worked the best and was safe, and that there is a two out of three chance that your child will receive less than that amount.   If your child is in one of the two groups with the lower amounts of ribavirin and your child is not getting better after 12 weeks, we will put your child in the group to get the largest amount of ribavirin.  
Your child will be taking two pills a day for one year.  We will ask you to bring your child to the hospital every month for an exam and tests to see if the medicine is working and to see if there are any unexpected side effects.
We will ask you to drop out of the study if:
* There are any unexpected side effects
* Your doctor thinks it is best for your child
* The medicine is not working after 24 weeks]  PLEASE DELETE THIS BULLET IF THE STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLYL TO THIS STUDY 
C. POTENTIAL RISKS/DISCOMFORT
1. List all risks that are "more than minimal" (risks that have greater probability or magnitude than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during routine medical tests).  Include physical, psychological, social, economic, legal or other risks, where present.  If there are numerous risks, add the sample table on the following page to the summary of risks listed here.

[Sample:  There are some risks to the treatment your child will be given in this study:
* Interferon shots can cause pain, redness or swelling, and there may be some oozing from the spot where the needle went in.
* Your child may have an allergic reaction to either interferon or ribavirin.
* Sometimes, children who are given both drugs get headaches, fever, chills and upset stomachs, like having the "flu."  This usually gets better after a few shots.
* There are sometimes more serious side effects.  Interferon can make your child depressed (feel sad) and ribavirin can cause anemia (low iron).  The two drugs together can cause coughing, itching, problems in breathing, dizziness or thyroid problems. 
* Rare mild side effects include diarrhea, stomach pain, dry skin and eye infection.
* Rare serious side effects include weight loss, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and lung and liver problems that could lead to death.
* We will look for side effects when we examine your child and take blood tests.  Your child's doctor may have to lower the amount or stop giving the drugs if the side effects are serious.  
* We do not know if the two drugs will help your child or make your child worse.  There may be risks we don't know about.  We will tell you if we find out about new risks that may affect your willingness to continue in the study.] 
2. Describe the severity and probability of all material risks, and the implications, in understandable terms.  Use a table for Common (21-100/100), Occasional (5-20/100) and Rare (<5/100) risks sorted by Immediate (1-2 days of treatment), Prompt (within 2-3 weeks before next course), Delayed (any later time during treatment) and Late (after completion of treatment) onset wherever possible[A2]
.

Ifosfamide
Common
Happens to 21-100 children out of every 100Occasional
Happens to 5-20 children out of every 100Rare
Happens to <5 children out of every 100Immediate:

Within 2-3 weeks, prior to next courseDecrease in the number of red and white blood cells and platelets made in the bone marrow, abnormal changes in the heart function shown on the electrocardiogram (ECG), increased risk of bleeding; blood clotsBleeding and irritation of the urinary bladder, damage to the heart with abnormal heart tissueDelayed:
Any time later during therapy, excluding the above conditionsHair lossAbnormal kidney function, loss of certain important salts and minerals by the bodyNumbness, tingling, clumsiness, sudden kidney failure, damage to the liver, damage/scarring to lung tissue, sleepiness, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures, damage to the liver, decreased ability to have children
Late:
Any time after completion of treatmentCancer caused by treatment for a previous cancer or leukemia, damage/scarring to bladder tissue

D. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION[A3]
There will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled if you decide to withdraw from the study.

E. POTENTIAL BENEFITS
1. Explain the expected direct benefits to the participant, if any, and their likelihood.  If none, say so. 
2. You may mention general benefits for science, or for other persons, if any.

[Sample:  The children who are part of the study will help us find out if using the two drugs together is a better treatment for hepatitis C than using only one drug.  If it is, your child may do better than with interferon alone.] 
F. ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION		
1. Explain the treatment alternatives in sufficient detail for meaningful comparison with participation in the study to assist in enabling an informed decision.  

[Sample:  If your doctor thinks that any treatment other than what your child will get in this study would be better for your child, your doctor will tell you that and will not ask your child to be in this study.  The only treatment now used for hepatitis C is interferon alone, and it only works in 15-20% of children.]

J. ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS 
When appropriate, discuss the following topics if not covered elsewhere.  
* Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)
A new Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways: 
* Health insurance companies may not request your genetic information that we get from this research 
* Health insurance companies may not use your genetic information when deciding whether to insure you or the amount of money they will charge you. 
* Employers may not use your genetic information that we get from this research when deciding to hire, promote, or fire you. 
This new Federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. 

* Students and Employees in Research

If you are an employee or a student, your decision to participate or not participate will have no bearing on your employment or academic standing.  Your participation is voluntary.  If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant, contact the Manager of the Office for the Protection of Human Subjects (OPHS) at 301-565-8485 

* Dietary supplements alternative ("herbal" or "complementary") remedies 
There are many drugs (prescription and over-the-counter), dietary supplements, and alternative ("herbal" or "complementary") remedies that might interact with the study drug(s). Before starting the study, you should tell your study doctor about all of the medications and supplements you are currently taking. The study doctor will review all of these with you and determine if you can participate in the study. Also, before you take any new medications or supplements you must discuss it with the study doctor.

* Reproductive Risks[A18]

For pregnancy/ risk to fetus (For Women):
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child.  You should not become pregnant or breast feed your baby while being treated on this study.  If you are sexually active and are at risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.  If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If you become pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your doctor immediately.
  
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You should not nurse your baby for the whole time you are getting the study medicines. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid nursing.
 
For pregnancy/ risk to fetus (For Men): 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm. You should not father a child while on this study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child.  If you are sexually active and are at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or your must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about the acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your doctor immediately.

* Additional costs to participants to take part[A19]
           
Children's Hospital will give you the medicine used in this study for free. You will not be charged for anything else we do that is part of the study.  You will still have to pay for any medical care that is not part of the study.  

* Consequences of withdrawing 
* Significant new findings to be provided 
* Termination from the study at discretion of investigator or sponsor
* Approximate number of total participants
