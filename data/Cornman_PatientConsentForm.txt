PATIENT CONSENT FORM
(HIPAA)
I understand that I have certain rights to privacy regarding my protected health
information. These rights are given to me under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). I understand that by signing this consent I
authorize you to use and disclose my protected health information to carry out:
¾ Treatment (including direct or indirect treatment by other healthcare providers
involved in my treatment)
¾ Obtaining payment from third party payers (e.g. my insurance company)
¾ The day to day healthcare operations of your practice
I have also been informed of, and given the right to review and secure a copy of your
Notice of Privacy Practices, which contains a more complete description of the uses
and disclosures of my protected health information, and my rights under HIPAA. I
understand that you reserve the right to change the terms of this notice from time to
time and that I may contact you at any time to obtain the most current copy of this
notice.
I understand that I have the right to request restrictions on how my protected health
information is used and disclosed to carry out treatment, payment, and health care
operations, but that you are not required to agree to these requested restrictions.
However, if you do agree, you are then bound to comply with this restriction.
I understand that I may revoke this consent, in writing, at any time. However, any
use or disclosure that occurred prior to the date I revoke this consent is not affected.
