Denture Treatment Consent Form
Please Read And Initial The Items Checked Below. Also, Read And Sign The Section At The Bottom Of Form.

 I realize that full or partial dentures are artificial, constructed of plastic, metal,
and/or porcelain. The problems of wearing these appliances have been explained
to me, including looseness, soreness, and possible breakage. I realize the final
opportunity to make changes in my new dentures (including shape, fit, size,
placement, and color) will be the “teeth in wax” try-in visit. I understand that most
dentures require relining approximately three to twelve months after initial
placement. The cost for this procedure is not included in the initial denture fee.
