INFORMED CONSENT FOR DENTAL IMPLANTS
Diagnosis. After careful oral examination and study of my dental condition, my doctor has advised me that my
missing tooth or teeth may be replaced with artificial teeth supported by an implant.
Recommended Treatment. In order to treat my condition, my doctor has recommended the use of root form
dental implants. I understand that the procedure for root form implants involves placing implants into the
jawbone. This procedure has a surgical phase followed by a prosthetic phase.
Surgical Phase of Procedures. I understand that sedation may be utilized and that a local anesthetic will be
administered to me as part of the treatment. My gum tissues will be opened to expose the bone. Implants will
be placed by tapping or threading them in to holes that have been drilled into my jawbone. The implants will
have to be snugly fitted and held tightly in place during the healing phase.
The gum and soft tissues will be stitched closed over or around the implants. A periodontal bandage or dressing
may be placed. Healing will be allowed to proceed for a period of four to six months. I understand the dentures
usually cannot be worn during the first one to two weeks of the healing phase.
I further understand that if clinical conditions turn out to be unfavorable for the use of this implant system or
prevent the placement of implants, my doctor will make a professional judgment on the management of the
situation. The procedure also may involve supplemental bone grafts or other types of grafts to build up the
ridge of my jaw and thereby to assist in placement, closure, and security of my implants.
For implants requiring a second surgical procedure, the overlying tissues will be opened at the appropriate time,
and the stability of the implant will be verified. If the implant appears satisfactory, an attachment will be
connected to the implant. Plans and procedures to create an implant prosthetic appliance can then begin.
Prosthetic Phase of Procedure. This phase is just as important as the surgical phase for the long-term success
of the oral reconstruction. During this phase, an implant prosthetic device will be attached to the implant.
Expected Benefits. The purpose of dental implants is to allow me to have more functional artificial teeth. The
implants provide support, anchorage, and retention for these teeth.
Principal Risks and Complications. I understand that some patients do not respond successfully to dental
implants, and in such cases, the implant may be lost. Implant surgery may not be successful in providing
artificial teeth. Because each patient’s condition is unique, long-term success may not occur.

These

Post surgical infection
Bleeding
Swelling
Pain
Facial discoloration
Transient but on occasion permanent numbness of the lip, tongue, teeth, chin, or gum
Jaw joint injuries or associated muscle spasm
Transient but on occasion permanent increased tooth looseness
Tooth sensitivity to hot, cold, sweet, or acidic foods
Shrinkage of the gum upon healing resulting in elongation of some teeth and greater spaces between
some teeth
Cracking or bruising of the corners of the mouth
Restricted ability to open the mouth for several days or weeks
Impact on speech
Allergic reactions
Injury to teeth
Bone fractures
Nasal sinus penetrations
Delayed healing
Accidental swallowing of foreign matter

The exact duration of any complications cannot be determined, and they may be irreversible.
I understand that the design and structure of the prosthetic appliance can be a substantial factor in the success or
failure of the implant. I further understand that alterations made on the artificial appliance or the implant can
lead to loss of the appliance or implant. This loss would be the sole responsibility of the person making such
alterations. IO am advised that the connection between the implant and the tissue may fail and that it may
become necessary to remove the implant. This can happen in the preliminary phase, during the initial
integration of the implant to the bone, or at any time thereafter.
Alternative to Suggested Treatment. Alternative treatments for missing teeth include no treatment, new
removable appliances, and other procedures—depending on the circumstances. However, continued wearing of
ill-fitting and loose removable appliances can result in further damage to the bone and soft tissue of my mouth.
Necessary Follow-up Care and Self-Care. I understand that it is important for me to continue to see my
dentist. Implants, natural teeth, and appliances have to be maintained daily in a clean, hygienic manner.
Implants and appliances must also be examined periodically and may need to b e adjusted. I understand that it
is important for me to abide by the specific prescriptions and instructions given by my doctor.
No Warranty or Guarantee. I hereby acknowledge that no guarantee, warranty, or assurance has been given
to me that the proposed treatment will be successful. Due to individual patient differences, a doctor cannot
-2-

predict certainty of success. There exists the risk of failure, relapse, additional treatment, or worsening of my
present condition, including the possible loss of certain teeth, despite the best of care.
Publication of Records. I authorize photos, slides, x-rays, or any other viewings of my care and treatment
during or after its completion to be used for the advancement of dentistry and for reimbursement purposes. My
identity will not be revealed to the general public, however, without my permission.

PATIENT CONSENT

I have been fully informed of the nature of root form implant surgery, the procedure to be utilized, the risks and
benefits of the surgery, the alternative treatments available, and the necessity for follow-up care and self care. I
have had an opportunity to ask any questions I may have in connection with the treatment and to discuss my
concerns with my doctor. After thorough deliberation, I hereby consent to the performance of dental implant
surgery as presented to me during consultation and in the treatment plan presentation as described in
this document.

I also consent to use of an alternative implant system or method if clinical conditions are found to be
unfavorable for the use of the implant systems that has been described to me. If clinical conditions prevent the
placement of implants, I defer to my doctor’s judgment on the surgical management of that situation. I also
give my permission to receive supplemental bone grafts or other types of grafts to build up the ridge of my jaw
and thereby to assist in placement, closure, and security of my implants.

I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE READ AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS DOCUMENT.
