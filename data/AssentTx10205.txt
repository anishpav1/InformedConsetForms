What is this study about? 
We are doing a research study.  A research study is a way to find out about something.  This study is being done to find out how [insert the reason the research is being done].
We want to know how [insert the reason the research is being done].  You are being asked if you want to be in this research study because you are [explain why the child is potential participant, such as:  a third-grade girl, someone who has gotten extra help with reading, a child who lives with their grandparents, or someone who has asthma.]
Examples:
* This study is being done to find out what amount of [insert the name/type of the medicine] medicine works best for children with [insert diagnosis under investigation].
* This study is being done to find out which medicine works better for children with [insert diagnosis under investigation].
* This study is being done to find out if [name/type of medicine] works better than no medicine at all for children with [diagnosis].

What will I need to do if I am in this study? If you want to be in the study, this is what will happen.  [Describe the procedures in very simple language. We suggest bullet point format.  To the extent possible, explain procedures/tests in terms of what the subject will already know.  For example, subjects already on asthma treatment will be familiar with pulmonary function tests; those who have had prior treatment for cancer are likely to have had various imaging studies, blood tests, biopsies] 
Examples:
* You will take a pill called [ X ] two times a day for three weeks.  We are testing [X] to see if it helps children with [diagnosis under investigation].
* Half of the people in this study will use an inhaler that has a medicine called [Y] in it.  The other half will use an inhaler that looks the same but doesn't have medicine in it (called a "placebo").  You won't know whether you are using the test medicine or the placebo.  Your doctor won't know, either.  This is a way for the researchers to find out if [Y] works better than no medicine at all. 
* You will be asked to do some breathing tests like the ones you usually have for asthma.  You also will have some blood taken. We will put a cream on your skin (Emlaâ) to help numb the skin so you don't feel the poke when we draw your blood.  
* We will do a test, called an ECG, to see how your heart is doing. The test won't hurt at all, but we will have to put some stickers connected to wires on your chest during the test. 
* Each time you see the study doctor or nurse, they will ask you how you're doing and give you a check up. They will check your heart and listen to your breathing. The doctor or nurse will also see how tall you are and how much you weigh. 

How long will I be in the study? [Describe how long participation in the study will last. A table or graph may be helpful when presenting information about the length of the study, number of visits, and/or procedures at each visit] 
Examples:
* You will be in this study for 1 year. You will come to the hospital 3 times to see the study doctor. 
* You will be in this study until your cancer becomes worse or you become very sick from the study treatment.

Can I stop being in the study? You may stop being in the study at any time and no one will be mad at you.  

What bad things might happen to me if I am in the study?  There are some parts of the study that might hurt or upset you.  [Describe in very simple language the risks and discomforts, both physical and emotional, that the child may experience.  Limit the list to major, likely risks]
Examples: 
* [Name/type of investigational drug] may not work as well as other medicines.
* [Name/type of investigational treatment] may make you feel sick or hurt parts of your body.  This is called "side effects."
* The study medicine may make you sicker faster than your cancer.  You could die from taking the study medicine.
* You will lose the hair on your head.
* You may feel embarrassed when we ask you questions about your feelings
* You may feel scared when we ask you to lie still in the MRI machine.
* It may hurt when we take blood from your arm.

What good things might happen to me if I am in the study?  We don't know if this study will help you.  The study medicine may help you, but we cannot promise that it will. We hope to learn something that will help other people some day. 

Will I be given anything for being in this study? 
Examples:
* If you decide to be in this study, you will be given a gift card for $10.
* You will not be given money or anything else to take part in this study.

Who can I talk to about the study? If you have any questions about the study or problems, you can talk to your parents, guardian or anyone on the research team.  You can contact the research team at [Insert PI/Research Staff contact information].

What happens if I get hurt? 
If you are hurt while you are on this study, your parent or guardian should contact the researchers. 

What if I do not want to do this? You don't have to be in this study.  It is up to you.  You can decide whether or not you want to be in this study, and you can stop being in it if you want to. If you say okay now, but change your mind later, that's okay too. No one will be mad at you if you decide to stop.  The doctor will still take care of you. 

If you do not want to be in this research study, we will tell you what other kinds of treatments there are for you.


Child Authorization: 
Your mom or dad (or guardian) has to give permission for you to be in this study if you decide you want to participate. 

I have been told about the study and what I will need to do if I agree to be a part of it.  I agree to be in this study. I have been told that I can stop at any time.  I asked and got answers to my questions [if participation involves a one-time activity]  OR If I have any questions, at any time, they will be answered [if study involves multiple visits/activities over time].  I can keep a copy of this paper.
