The investigator signature line is required for FDA-regulated research, but also may be required by the reviewing IRB panel. The purpose of this line is to document that the PI or Co-Investigator reviewed the qualifications of the subject to be in this study. The IRB may require this signature line if the inclusion/exclusion criteria are complex, or if the study poses significant risks to subjects. If you are including this signature line (or if required by the IRB), please enter the number of days within which the PI or Co-Investigator will sign the form. The PI or Co-Investigator should sign the form in an appropriate amount of time to receive the necessary screening results to determine subject eligibility, but before the subject begins study procedures (maximum 30 days). If a Co-Investigator is signing on behalf of the PI, this delegation of responsibility should be documented.
