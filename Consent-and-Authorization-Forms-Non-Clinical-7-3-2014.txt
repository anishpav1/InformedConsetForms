Research Consent and Authorization Form

TITLE: Title of the study.  Use the same title as that on the Initial Review Questionnaire (IRQ).


PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####
CO-INVESTIGATORS:	[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####[list name and degree(s)]  (503) 494-####
The Principal Investigator (PI) must be listed on the consent form. Listing co-investigators on the consent form is optional.  It is recommended that you limit the number of co-investigators listed here by listing only those most likely to conduct the consent discussion.


FUNDED BY:  List all organizations/entities providing monetary support for the study, regardless of whether funds are received directly or through another organization (such as a cooperative group or foundation).

SUPPORTED BY:   List any organizations/entities providing non-monetary support only.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  All potential conflicts of interest in research (CoIR) must be disclosed and evaluated by the COI committee.  After evaluation, the COI committee may require specific language to be inserted into the consent form.  If directed, place the language here.  For more information on CoIR, visit: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/about/integrity/coi/

PURPOSE:
If the study includes both children and adults and all procedures are identical for both children and adults, state: “You” means you or your child in this consent form.  (For other studies involving children, address the consent form to the parent referring to children as “your child.”) 

Include and complete the following sentences: You have been invited to be in this research study because __________.  The purpose of this study is to __________. 

State how long the study will last.  Sample language (modify as appropriate): This study requires 7 visits to the clinic and will take 8 weeks to complete.

If the study involves genetic research and/or storing data or specimens in a repository for future research, state that here.  Indicate whether subjects can opt out of these activities and still participate in the study.

Suggested wording for genetic research (use all that apply, modify as appropriate):

The purpose of the study is to understand the inheritance of (disorder).  If a gene or genes that cause (disorder) can be found, the diagnosis and treatment of (disorder) may be improved. 

Genes are the units of DNA--the chemical structure carrying your genetic information--that determine many human characteristics such as the color of your eyes, your height, and whether you are male or female.

The samples provided by you will be analyzed in the laboratory to determine whether there are differences in the genes of people with and without (disorder). 

Suggested wording for repositories (modify as appropriate):

We are asking you to provide [blood/tissue/information] for a [blood/tissue/data] bank, also called a repository.  These samples will be stored indefinitely and may be used and disclosed in the future for research, which may include genetic research.

Indicate how many subjects will be enrolled into the experiment both at OHSU and, where applicable, for the entire study.

For studies conducted at the PVAMC as well, state:
This study will be conducted at both the PVAMC and OHSU. The study procedures that will occur at PVAMC will be discussed in detail in the VA Consent Form.

PROCEDURES:  
Describe succinctly and in chronological order the procedures for this study.  It is not necessary to describe in detail procedures that are routine care and not required by the protocol. However, procedures that are required by the protocol must be included, even if they would occur if the subject did not participate in the research.  If appropriate, indicate which procedures would be done regardless of whether the subject participates in the study.

Clearly indicate which, if any, procedures are optional and state that subjects will be able to indicate their choice at the end of the form.

State how much time the visits and procedures will require.  If studies are complex, use a simple table showing what procedures will occur at each study visit.  In most cases, tables provided by the sponsor in the study protocol are too complex to be of help to most subjects.  Example:


Visit 1
Day 1Visit 2
Day 14Visit 3
Month 3Visit 4
Month 6Visit 5
Month 12Consent Discussion, Screening tests and medical history XUrine CollectionXXXXXQuality of Life QuestionnaireXXXTotal time4 hours30 minutes30 minutes3 hours3 hours
If questionnaires, surveys, diaries, or other data collection materials are being used, mention what kinds of questions will be asked and how long the tasks will take to complete, and upload a copy of each to your eIRB application.

If the subject’s medical records will be reviewed (from OHSU or requested from another facility), state this and describe the information to be collected. 

If this is a genetic study and information about subjects’ relatives will be collected, state (modify as appropriate): You may be asked to give us health information about your relatives. Any information you give us will be kept confidential as described in this consent. We will not contact your relatives without their permission. We may discuss with you the possibility of including your relatives in the study in the future.

If this study includes a repository and data/samples may be shared with the funder and/or other researchers, state: In the future, your [samples/information] may be given to [researchers, the funder, list as appropriate] for other research studies.  [If applicable: These studies may include genetic research.]  The [samples and/or information] will be labeled as described in the CONFIDENTIALITY section.  

If this study includes collection of identifiable photographs (including identifiable images and physical likenesses), videotapes, or audiotapes that will be presented in public, state: During this study [you, your image, your physical likeness] will be photographed, videotaped, or audiotaped [specify which].  We will use the photographs, videotapes, or audiotapes for educational materials, research publications, or marketing purposes [specify which]. [NOTE: if these materials will be used for marketing purposes, contact the ORIO.  Additional requirements may apply.]


• [Describe succinctly and in chronological order the recording procedures. Specify the duration of the recording sessions.]

• [If attempts to conceal the participant’s identity will be made, explain how (black bar over eyes, voice disguised, etc).]

• [Inform participants whether they will be able to inspect the photographs/recordings before they are released.]

State: If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this study now or in the future, contact [PI Name (503) 494-####] [or other members of the study team at (503) ###-####].  (The PI phone number must match the first page of this consent form.)   
 
SUBJECT ACCESS TO GENETIC INFORMATION: (include if this study involves genetics or if future research studies may involve genetics)

Note that no information may be disclosed to anyone other than the subject without the subject’s permission, except as permitted by law.  Further, results may be disclosed to the subject or the subject’s physician only if the laboratory generating the results is CLIA-approved.

If findings of any kind (e.g., results of genetic studies, clinically relevant information, or incidental findings) are to be disclosed to the subject, describe the disclosure procedures (e.g., who will make the disclosure and to whom; a referral to a genetic counselor or a referral for appropriate medical advice must be provided). 

The subjects must be informed as to whether or not they will be contacted if the results of the study are found to have clinical relevance in the future or for any other reason.  If the subjects are not informed that they will be re-contacted in the consent document, any attempt to re-contact the subject by the researcher must first be approved by the IRB.

If no disclosures are to be made, explain why.

Suggested wording (use all that apply):

The results of these studies will not be made available to you because the research is still in an early phase and the reliability of the results is unknown.

If we discover new information that is important for your health care, either in this study or the future, you will be asked whether you wish to receive the results.  You may be required to have the test repeated in a clinical laboratory.  Because genetic information is complex and sensitive, the results should be discussed with a genetic counselor or your primary care giver who can answer your questions or discuss your concerns.  You would be responsible for all costs associated with having the test repeated and visiting a doctor or genetic counselor to discuss the results.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS: 
Describe reasonably foreseeable risks, side effects, discomforts, and inconveniences.  List the risks in order of their importance.

Indicate if a risk applies only to a part of the study that is optional.

For studies involving interviews/questionnaires/QOL assessments that discuss sensitive issues that may cause emotional upset, such as grieving, and not just routine matters: The risk of emotional upset must be described, and subjects must be informed that they may refuse to answer questions that upset them.  Sample language (modify as appropriate):  Some of these questions may seem very personal or embarrassing.  They may upset you.  You may refuse to answer any of the questions that you do not wish to answer.  If the questions make you very upset, we will help you to find a counselor.

For genetic or repository studies:  Describe risks that may result from storage of samples/information in a repository, future research studies, or genetic research.  Specifically consider and address the risks associated with breach of confidentiality or psychological trauma.  Breach of confidentiality could impact insurability, employability, family plans, and family relationships.  Psychological risks to consider include the impact of learning results if no effective therapy for the disorder exists or the risk of stigmatization.

For genetic studies or future research that may include genetics, state:
A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Be aware that this federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  GINA also does not protect you against discrimination if you have already been diagnosed with the genetic disease being tested.

Although we have made efforts to protect your identity, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  If the results of these studies of your genetic makeup were to be accidentally released, it might be possible that the information we will gather about you as part of this study could become available to an insurer or an employer, or a relative, or someone else outside the study. Even though there are certain genetic discrimination and confidentiality protections in both Oregon law and federal law, there is still a small chance that you could be harmed if a release occurred.

If genetic information will be released to subjects, state:  The results of this study could provide information about how likely it is that you or one of your children or other relatives will develop [disorder] in the future. This may be very upsetting because [there is no therapy for (disorder) or the results may show that (disorder) may be passed on to children, or any other reason].

BENEFITS:	
Unless direct benefits to the subject are assured, use the following language:  You may or may not personally benefit from being in this study.  However, by serving as a subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.

When the subject will not benefit, but is participating solely for altruistic motives, use the following language:  You will not benefit from being in this study.  However, by serving as a subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.

ALTERNATIVES: 
State: You may choose not to be in this study.

CONFIDENTIALITY:
State:  We will take steps to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.  [If there are special precautions this study is taking to achieve this, describe here, e.g., collecting data anonymously or coding samples immediately so they are never identified.]

If study involves PHI, state:  We will create and collect health information about you as described in the Purpose and Procedures sections of this form.  Health information is private and is protected under federal law and Oregon law.  By agreeing to be in this study, you are giving permission (also called authorization) for us to use and disclose your health information as described in this form.

State:  The investigators, study staff, and others at OHSU may use the information we collect and create about you in order to conduct and oversee this research study [and store in a repository, conduct future research, as applicable; state if any of these are optional].

We may release this information to others outside of OHSU who are involved in conducting or overseeing research, including [list as applicable]:

• The funder of this study, [funder name], and the funder’s representatives 
• The Food and Drug Administration
• The Office for Human Research Protections, a federal agency that oversees research involving humans[Specify others, such as NCI, NIH, coordinating centers, etc.]

Those listed above may also be permitted to review and copy your records.

We may also share your information with other researchers, who may use it for future research studies. [Only include if other researchers may receive PHI; state if this is optional.]

We will not release information about you to others not listed above, unless required or permitted by law.  We will not use your name or your identity for publication or publicity purposes, unless we have your special permission.

For studies involving interviews, questionnaires, surveys, or other procedures during which such information may be learned, state: Under Oregon law, suspected child or elder abuse must be reported to appropriate authorities.

If applicable, also state:  OHSU complies with Oregon state requirements for reporting certain diseases and conditions to local health departments.

State:  When we send specimens or information outside of OHSU, they may no longer be protected under federal or Oregon law.  In this case, your specimens or information could be used and re-released without your permission.

If applicable, indicate how information will be shared with other researchers (not industry sponsors) and whether shared materials will include identified information or genetic information.  Examples (modify based on your planned procedures for sample and data labeling):
[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  A code number will be assigned to you, your cells and genetic information, as well as to information about you.  Only the investigators and people involved in the conduct of the study will be authorized to link the code number to you.  Other investigators who may receive samples of your [blood/tissue/genetic information/medical information] for research will be given only the code number which will not identify you. 

       or

[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  All identifying information about you will be removed from the samples before they are released to any other investigators. 

       or

[Data/specimens] from this study may be shared with other investigators for future research studies.  Your samples will be labeled with [your name or other information (specify)] that will identify you.  Other investigators who may receive samples of your [blood/tissue/genetic information/medical information] for research will also be given information that may identify you or your family members.  

State:  We may continue to use and disclose your information as described above indefinitely. [Specify alternate end date or event if applicable.]

If study involves PHI, state:  Some of the information collected and created in this study may be placed in your OHSU medical record.  While the research is in progress, you may or may not have access to this information.  After the study is complete, you will be able to access any study information that was added to your OHSU medical record.  If you have questions about what study information you will be able to access, and when, ask the investigator.

Additional Protections for Special Types of Information [Delete this entire section if not applicable.]

Oregon Law provides special protection for drug and alcohol diagnosis, treatment, or referral information and mental health records from Oregon publicly funded or contracted mental health providers (e.g. Oregon State Hospital or Oregon publicly funded alcoholism, drug addiction, or mental health programs).
