Introduction
You are being asked to take part in a research study. This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will do if you choose to be in this research study, and the way we would like to use information about you and your health.  

Conflict of Interest Disclosure
The following disclosure is made to give you an opportunity to decide if this relationship will affect your willingness to participate in this research study:

 When the investigator is also the treating physician, insert:    
Your doctor, who is also the person responsible for this research study, For cases when the subjects will not always be recruited by their doctor, you may use “If your doctor is also the person responsible for this research study, please note that he/she…"  is interested in both your clinical care and the conduct of this research study.  You have the right to discuss this study with another person who is not part of the research team before making your decision whether or not to be in the study. 

For any other type of conflict of interest, use the IRB's template language: http://irb.northwestern.edu/templates-forms/consent 
What is the reason for doing this study?
The purpose of this study is to…  You are being asked to participate because
• Explain the purpose of the study and why the person is being asked to participate.

• If the study involves an investigational drug or device, state this and clarify that “investigational” means it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration”

• If the study is  Double-Blind, Randomized, or Phase I-IV, insert the appropriate statement from the IRB’s template language: http://irb.northwestern.edu/templates-forms/consent 


How many people will take part in this study?  Optional unless this is a Phase I study  
The study investigators hope to enroll  #  subjects at NU and  #  nationwide.  

What will you do if you choose to be in this study? 
If you consent to participate, you will be asked to …

• Describe in detail, preferably in chronological order, all study related procedures, including surveys, focus groups, audio or video taping, assignment to study groups, medications, etc.  Include where they will be performed, their frequency, and the total duration of the study. 

• IRB template language for certain procedures is available: http://irb.northwestern.edu/templates-forms/consent 

• Identify which procedures are experimental and which are standard of care.    

• Do not include procedures which would occur regardless of the subject's participation in the study unless doing so would aid in the subject's overall understanding of the study. 

What are some of the possible risks and discomforts? 
The risks from the study procedures include…
• Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, side effects, and discomforts of each drug, device or study procedure (physical, psychological, social and legal). For each procedure, drug, or device, order the risks based on likelihood.    

• IRB template language for certain procedures is available: http://irb.northwestern.edu/templates-forms/consent 

When appropriate, insert: 
• There may also be other side effects that we cannot predict.  or
• This study may involve risks that we cannot predict to you or your embryo or fetus if you become pregnant. or
• These risks may be serious and life-threatening. 

Do not include 
• Risks from procedures that would be performed regardless of whether the person chooses to participate in this study unless doing so would aid in the subject’s overall understanding of the study.  Such procedures should already be described in the section “What will you do if you choose to be in the study?”, or
• Animal study risks unless there is has been very little research with humans and the inclusion of the risks may help to convey information about potential risks to humans such as in Phase I trials.       


What do I need to know about reproductive health/sexual activity if I am in this study?   Include only if applicable. If the reproductive risks apply only to one gender, the paragraph below should be appropriately modified.     

The effect of the study drug on human sperm and eggs has not been studied. The effects on the developing fetus using the study drug during pregnancy and the risk of birth defects are also unknown or may be unforeseeable.   If data exists about the safety of the drug during pregnancy add it here.    Therefore, both men and women should not attempt pregnancy and women should not be pregnant or breast-feeding while taking part in this study   or for XX amount of time after completing the study .

If sexually active, both men and women should use an effective method of birth control while taking the study drug. Barrier contraceptives (condoms or diaphragm) with spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUD’s), hormonal contraceptives, oral contraceptive pills, surgical sterilization, and complete abstinence are examples of effective methods. If you or your partner become pregnant while taking the study drug, it is important that you tell your study nurse/doctor immediately. You may have to stop the study drug.  Other treatment options will be discussed with you if you stop the study drug.

If subjects should be informed of methods to protect against sexually transmitted diseases, insert the following statement, otherwise delete: Only methods that use condoms provide reasonable/true protection against sexually transmitted diseases.  

If participating subjects are postmenopausal women, the paragraph below should be included, otherwise, delete:   
Since you are considered to be postmenopausal, you are not required to use contraception while in this study.  Rarely, women considered to be postmenopausal become pregnant.  If you suspect that you become pregnant while taking the study drug, it is important that you tell the study nurse/doctor immediately.  You may have to stop the study drug.  Other treatment options will be discussed with you if you stop the study drug.

Certificate of Confidentiality  Include if applicable  
The principal investigator has a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government.  A Certificate of Confidentiality helps protect the privacy of human research participants enrolled in studies that collect sensitive information.  Certificates protect against legal demands, such as court orders and subpoenas, for information that could identify you in this study.

If acquiring a Certificate of Confidentiality would be excessive, consider the following: 
In this study, you will be asked about  e.g.,  illegal activities, sensitive information . We will keep information about you as confidential as possible, but complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. On rare occasions, courts have subpoenaed research records.

Mandated Reporter Language  Include if applicable 

In studies in which researchers are probing for or likely to elicit information about child or elder abuse or neglect, the State of Illinois requires researchers to report such information to authorities. The following statements should be added:  

If we learn about current or ongoing child  or elder   abuse or neglect we are required by law to report this to local law authorities.
