
Consent and Authorization Document
for Minimal Risk Research

Note to the Investigator:  Informed consent is a process, not just a form. Information must be presented to enable persons to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research participant. It is a fundamental mechanism to ensure respect for persons through provision of thoughtful consent for a voluntary act. The procedures used in obtaining informed consent should be designed to educate the participant population in terms that they can understand. Therefore, informed consent language and its documentation (especially explanation of the study's purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits) must be written in "lay language", (i.e. understandable to the people being asked to participate). The written presentation of information is used to document the basis for consent and for the participants' future reference. The consent document should be revised when deficiencies are noted or when additional information will improve the consent process.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE OF THIS TEMPLATE: 
• Do not adjust the bottom margin or use the footer. Do not delete the watermark fields in the footer.
• Replace bracketed items in the header, such as “[Title of Study]” with the requested information. 
• Read guidelines for each section, complete as applicable for your project and then delete the template guidelines. Example text may be used if needed but should not be italicized. Instructions in red font should be replaced or deleted.  
• Example text may be used if needed but should not be italicized. Instructions in red font should be replaced or deleted.
• Phrases such as “I understand…” or “You understand…” are not appropriate and should not be included in the document.
• For studies involving deception or designed in such a way that providing complete background information will invalidate the study, clearly state this in your application. In addition, attach the debriefing script that will be used to inform participants of the need for deception and the procedures you will follow to address any possible adverse effects of the deception. In the application, you must request a “Waiver or Alteration of Consent” in the electronic application.  
• The document should be written at an appropriate grade level for the group of participants. Most word processors include the ability to assess the reading level.
• NOTE:  If your study is determined by the IRB to be more than minimal risk, there are additional elements of informed consent which will be required. If you believe your study is more than minimal risk, you may contact the IRB office for guidance or refer to the HIPAA Consent Template for a description of all the elements of informed consent.
