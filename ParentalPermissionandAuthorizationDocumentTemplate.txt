Parental Permission and Authorization Document

Note to the Investigator: Informed consent is a process, not just a form. Information must be presented to enable persons to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research participant. It is a fundamental mechanism to ensure respect for persons through provision of thoughtful consent for a voluntary act. The procedures used in obtaining informed consent should be designed to educate the participant population in terms that they can understand. Therefore, informed consent language and its documentation (especially explanation of the study's purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits) must be written in "lay language", (i.e. understandable to the people being asked to participate). The written presentation of information is used to document the basis for consent and for the participants' future reference. The consent document should be revised when deficiencies are noted or when additional information will improve the consent process.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE OF THIS TEMPLATE: 
• Do not adjust the bottom margin or use the footer. Do not delete the watermark fields in the footer.
• Replace bracketed items in the header, such as “[Title of Study]” with the requested information.
• Read the guidelines for each section, complete each section as applicable for your project, and then delete the template guidelines.  
• Example text may be used if needed but should not be left italicized. Instructions in red font should be replaced or deleted.
• Phrases such as “I understand…” or “You understand…” are not appropriate and should not be included in the document.
• The document should be written at an appropriate grade level for the group of participants. Most word processors include the ability to assess the reading level.
• For placebo trials the following must be addressed:
o The term “placebo” must be included as part of the study title or added as a sub-title in the informed consent.  
o Follow the section-specific instructions for placebo trials as outlined in the Procedures and Risks sections of this template.

BACKGROUND
Explain that the study involves research and explain the purpose of the research. Briefly tell the parent/guardian why this research is being done, why the child is being invited to participate, and how this study will address the problem. Briefly explain who is conducting the study and who is sponsoring the study. If applicable, describe why current therapies are not satisfactory and why an alternative treatment or approach will be used. If applicable, state that the drug or device used in the study is or is not investigational and whether or not it has been approved by the FDA. Other suggested elements appear in the first example.

Example: Your child is being asked to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with friends and relatives if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you will allow your child to take part in this research study.
Example: The purpose of the study is <<explain purpose of the research using simple, accurate language>>. This study is being conducted by <<insert sponsor, granting agency, investigator, etc.>>.

For studies involving Phase I, II, or III the following sample explanations may be included.
Example: Phase 1 studies are early human studies done after the animal models have given basic data. They are done on a small number of people to find out about safe dose ranges. 
Example: Phase 2 studies are done on a larger number of human subjects to see if a new drug is safe. They are also done to find out if the drug works and does what it is supposed to do. 
Example: Phase 3 studies test a new drug longer and on more people. They are done to learn details about the use of the new drug in many people during their usual activities of daily living. 

STUDY PROCEDURES
This section should tell the parent/guardian about what the child will have to do, undergo or experience in the study. Describe all procedures in lay language using simple terms and short sentences. Include a description of the study procedures involved and identify which treatments or procedures that are experimental. (Standard therapy should be included if it is part of the study protocol.) Provide a time-line description (e.g. week 1, week 2, 4 weeks later, etc.) of the procedures that will be performed, the drugs that will be administered, all hospitalizations, and all outpatient visits, etc. Include the total length of time that the participants will be involved both in the active study and for follow-up.

If applicable, include information regarding pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential and indicate the frequency of pregnancy testing. Also, state who will receive the results in the event of a positive pregnancy test (e.g. parent, child, or both).

The following are suggested lay definitions which may be included if applicable:
Randomized Trial: A research trial usually involves comparing different treatments. In a trial, one group will get one treatment and another group will get a different treatment. In a “randomized trial” people are put in one group or the other by random chance. This means that a computer will decide by chance which group a person is in, not the doctors running the trial.

Parents/guardians should be told what chance their child has of getting the study drug/treatment e.g. a one in four chance, a 50:50 chance, etc.

Single Blind Trial: In a blind trial you will not know which treatment group your child is in. 

Double Blind Trial: In this trial, neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment group your child is in (although, if your doctor needs to find out for important medical reasons, he/she can do so).

For studies involving placebo or withheld treatment, the following must be addressed:  
• The reason for the placebo or withheld treatment must be explained.
• “Placebo” should be defined in lay terms. 
• Any withheld treatment must be detailed. 
• Any related procedures should be detailed in this section. If applicable, include any plan for rescue therapy, special monitoring, or crossover to placebo.

Example definition of placebo: A placebo is a dummy treatment such as a pill which looks like the pill that contains the study drug but is not. Placebos contain no drugs or active ingredients. Study participants are given placebos so that the effects of a drug can be compared against no drug.  Use of placebos also prevents the participant and the doctor from knowing whether or not the subject is getting the drug.

RISKS
Include a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts or side-effects the participant may experience for each procedure and drug (including the possibility that an experimental treatment may be ineffective). List all side effects which are life-altering or potentially life-altering, no matter how rare. Minor risks such as the possible breach of confidentiality should be listed.

For studies involving placebo or withheld treatment, potential risks must be adequately explained, including any risks of non-treatment. 

REPRODUCTIVE RISKS
For studies involving possible reproductive risks, please include a section that includes the following:
1. State any known risks in pregnancy, either to mother or child.
2. State that there may be unforeseeable risks to the participant (or to the embryo or fetus) if the participant is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the study.
3. List the acceptable methods of birth control for this research project.

Example: It is possible that if the treatment is given to a pregnant woman it will harm the unborn child. Pregnant women must not take part in this study, nor should women who plan to become pregnant during the study. Women who are at risk of pregnancy will be asked to have a pregnancy test before taking part to exclude the possibility of pregnancy. If your child could become pregnant, your child must use an effective contraceptive during the course of this study. Acceptable methods of birth control include <<list acceptable methods>>.  If your child becomes pregnant while taking part in the study, you or your child must immediately tell your research doctor. Options will be discussed with you and your child at that time. Whether or not your child remains on study treatment, we will follow the outcome of your child’s pregnancy and we will continue to follow your child according to the study plan.

UNFORESEEABLE RISKS
State that participation in the study may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable. 

Example: In addition to the risks listed above, your child may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect. 


BENEFITS
This section should describe any potential benefits to the participant or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research. DO NOT include any compensation to be offered to participants. The description of benefits to the participant should be clear and not overstated to avoid coercion. If no direct benefit is anticipated, it should be stated. If research results will be given to the participant, it should be stated.

Example: We cannot promise any benefits to your child from your being in the study. However, possible benefits may include <<list benefits>>. 
Example: There are no direct benefits to your child from your taking part in this study. The information we get from this study may help us treat future patients.
Example: We hope that this study will help your child, however, this cannot be guaranteed.  

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES
Describe any alternative procedures or courses of treatment that might be advantageous to the participant. To enable a rational choice about participating in the research study, individuals should be aware of the full range of options available to them including palliative or comfort care (if applicable). If standard therapy is part of the study protocol, the participant must be told he/she can receive it outside of the study.

Example: You may choose not to be in this study. If you do not want to take part in the study, there are other choices such as <<list alternatives>>.You may discuss these options with your doctor. 

PERSON TO CONTACT
Explain whom the parent/guardian should contact with any questions, complaints, and concerns about the research or related matters. If the study involves serious risks, a number with 24-hour availability must be provided. If the number is a pager or the hospital operator include further instructions for contacting the appropriate individual.  

Include specific information about who the parent/guardian should contact in case of a research-related injury. This should include name(s), telephone number(s), and when the person(s) listed may be contacted. If applicable, provide information about who to contact if the parent/guardian has questions about the billing of costs in the study.  

Example: If you have questions, complaints or concerns about this study, you can contact <<insert name>> at <<insert phone number>>. If you think your child may have been injured from being in this study, please call <<insert name>> at <<insert phone number>>. <<Insert name>> can be reached at this number during <<specify hours or state it is a number available 24-hours a day>>.

Include the following statement verbatim:  Institutional Review Board: Contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if you have questions regarding your child’s rights as a research participant. Also, contact the IRB if you have questions, complaints or concerns which you do not feel you can discuss with the investigator. The University of Utah IRB may be reached by phone at (801) 581-3655 or by e-mail at irb@hsc.utah.edu.  

Include the following statement verbatim: Research Participant Advocate:  You may also contact the Research Participant Advocate (RPA) by phone at (801) 581-3803 or by email at participant.advocate@hsc.utah.edu. 

RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY
Include the Research-Related Injury section as outlined:

If your child is injured from being in this study, medical care is available at the <<insert appropriate institution(s) e.g. University of Utah or Primary Children's Hospital >>, as it is to all sick or injured people. The University of Utah <<and Primary Children’s Hospital>> has not set aside any money to pay the costs for such care.  The University <<and Primary Children’s Hospital>> will work with you to address costs from injuries. Costs would be charged to you or your insurance company (if you have insurance), to the study sponsor or other third party (if applicable), to the extent those parties are responsible for paying for medical care your child receives. Since this is a research study, some health insurance plans may not pay for the costs. By signing this consent form you are not giving up your right to pursue legal action against any parties involved with this research.

If you have a sponsor or other party who is assuming responsibility for research-related injury, please include the language here. If you have questions, please contact the IRB office for guidance. 

Insert the following language verbatim: The University of Utah is a part of the government. If your child is injured in this study, and you want to sue the University or the doctors, nurses, students, or other people who work for the University, special laws may apply. The Governmental Immunity Act of Utah is a law that controls when a person needs to bring a claim against the government, and limits the amount of money a person may recover. See sections 63G -7-101 to -904 of the Utah Code.

If your study takes place at Shriners, please add the following additional language: Also, in the event of injury or undesirable reaction from participation in research-related activities, Shriners Hospitals for Children can only provide those medical services available at the Shriners Salt Lake City Hospital. Shriners Hospitals for Children has no program to provide any financial compensation for a research-related injury or an undesirable reaction. If you believe that your child has sustained an injury as a result of participating in this research program, please also contact the investigators and/or Chief of Staff, Shriners Hospitals for Children, Salt Lake City Hospital, at (801) 536-3600. By signing this document you are not giving up your right to pursue legal action against any and all parties involved with this research.

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
State that participation is voluntary. Indicate that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled. Also indicate that the participant may discontinue participation at any time without any penalty or loss to benefits. If applicable, state that the parent/guardian may withdraw their child and still receive the same standard of care that their child would otherwise have received.  

Example: Research studies include only people who choose to take part.  You can tell us that you don’t want your child to be in this study.  Your child can start the study and then choose to stop the study later.  We will still give your child medical care and answer any questions you have.  Your decision will not affect your relationship with your child’s doctor or the study team in any way.

Explain any possible consequences of the decision to withdraw from the research. Describe any adverse effects on the participant’s health or welfare, or any extra follow-up that may be requested, if the parent/guardian decides to withdraw their child from the study. Explain the procedures for an orderly termination of participation. Such an explanation may be omitted if there are no adverse consequences to withdrawal.

Example: If you decide to stop your child from being in this study, please let the research doctor know. That way you can find out what should be done about your child’s routine care outside of the study.

RIGHT OF INVESTIGATOR TO WITHDRAW
Describe foreseeable circumstances under which the child’s participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the parent’s consent. This section may be omitted if there are no anticipated circumstances under which the child’s participation may be terminated. If withdrawal of a child by the investigator can occur, possible reasons should be listed. Describe any procedures required for an orderly termination of participation.  

Example: The investigator can withdraw your child without your approval. Possible reasons for withdrawal include <<list reason(s) why the child may be withdrawn>>. 

Include a description of any adverse effects on the child’s health or welfare, or follow-up that may be requested if the child is withdrawn from the study.

COSTS AND COMPENSATION TO PARTICIPANTS
Costs related to standard of care and costs related to research procedures should be separated and explained. Any additional costs to the parent/guardian that may result from the research should also be clearly indicated. If applicable, state that the parent/guardian may want to check whether their health insurance will cover research-related costs. When costs may be billed to the parent/guardian, insurance company, or both, statements such as “will be billed to you or your insurer in the ordinary manner” are preferred.

Example: All costs associated with this study will be billed to you or your insurance company in the ordinary manner. Your insurance company may not pay for the costs associated with research. Therefore, these costs <<state who will be responsible e.g. “will be your responsibility” or “will be paid by the sponsor” or “the sponsor has agreed to pay $XX”, etc.>>.  
Example: You will not be charged, nor will your insurance company be charged, for any test or visit that is completed solely for the purpose of this study.  
Example: The parts of your child’s care that would normally be done as standard treatment such as <<list procedures or refer to the procedures identified as standard of care in the “Procedures” section>> will be billed to you or your insurance company.

Explain whether participants will be compensated. If not, please state. Specify the overall amount, schedule of payment(s) and any plan for prorating payments if a participant does not complete the study.  

NEW INFORMATION
State that new findings developed during the course of the research that may affect to the participant’s willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject. This section may be omitted if new information could not reasonably used to alter participation (e.g. one-time interventions). 

Example: Sometimes during the course of a research project, new information becomes available about the <<treatment/drug>> that is being studied. If this happens, your child’s research doctor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want your child to continue in the study.  
Example (additional text if applicable): If you decide to withdraw your child at that time, the research doctor will make arrangements for your child’s medical care to continue. If you decide to allow your child to continue in the study, you will be asked to sign an updated consent form. Also, on receiving new information the research doctor might consider it to be in your child’s best interests to withdraw your child from the study. He/she will explain the reasons and arrange for your chirld’s medical care to continue.

NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS
State the approximate number of participants to be enrolled. Indicate whether this study is part of a national study.

Example: We expect to enroll <<enter number>> participants at the <<University of Utah, PCMC or Shriner’s Hospital>>.   
Example: We also expect to enroll <<enter number>> participants at <<enter number>> other Hospitals.
