Pluripotent Stem Cell Glossary


hEGCs – human embryonic germ cells

hESCs – human embryonic stem cells

hPSCs – human pluripotent stem cells

iPSCs – induced pluripotent stem cells

ISCRO – Institutional Stem Cell Research Oversight

SCNT – somatic cell nuclear transfer


Gametes - Gametes are reproductive cells that unite during sexual reproduction to form a new cell called a zygote.  In humans, male gametes are sperm and female gametes are ova (eggs).

Blastocyst - The blastocyst is a thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development (about 5-6 days) that contains a cluster of cells from which the embryo arises.  It consists of two primary cell types:

• the inner cell mass, also known as the "embryoblast", and 
• the trophoblast, a layer of cells surrounding the inner cell mass and the blastocyst cavity (blastocoele). 

The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic stem cells and gives rise to all later structures of the adult organism.  The trophoblast combines with the maternal endometrium to form the placenta in eutherian mammals.

Somatic Cells - The word “somatic” is derived from the Greek word “soma”, meaning “body”.  Hence, somatic cells are all body cells of an organism, apart from the sperm and egg cells, the cells from which they arise (gametocytes) and undifferentiated stem cells.

• As part this study, we will collect genetic information about you and the resulting data will be sent to the 	National Institutes of Health (NIH) Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) repository.  Please see the last page of this consent form for information about GWAS and your data.

2. Why is this research being done?


       
This research is being done to....



Your tissue sample may be used to create a living tissue sample (called a “cell line”) that can be grown in the laboratory.  This allows researchers to have an unlimited supply of your cells in the future without asking for more samples from you.



We may use the cells taken from your [specify source of cells, e.g. skin] to create a type of cell known as a pluripotent cell.  This type of cell can be used to create different types of tissue, including [specify type of cells, e.g. cardiac, muscle, etc.] cells.  Your cells might be used in research involving genetic alteration of the cells.



Your cells will (if known)/might (if unknown) be mixed with other human cells, mixed with animal cells, or grown in lab animals like mice.

   What you should know about the cell lines that will be derived in the course of this study?
• The cell lines created will be similar or identical to you genetically.
• The cell lines may be kept indefinitely.
• There is the possibility that your cells or the created cell lines might be used in research that will involve genetic manipulation of the cells or the mixing of human and non-human cells in animal models.
• The cell lines may be shared with researchers both inside and outside of Johns Hopkins, including our commercial partners.
• The cell lines may be used to develop treatments for a variety of diseases and conditions.



The use of “X” (study drug or device name) in this research study is investigational. The word “investigational” means that “X” is not approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA is allowing the use of “X” in this study.



“X” (drug or device name) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ___ (include disease name).  It is not approved for use in ___ (disease name).  The FDA is allowing the use of _”X” in this research study.






People with ______ may join. 


How many people will be in this study?



3. What will happen if you join this study?

If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:














   


The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) may help protect you from health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information.  

      The law provides that health insurance companies and group health plans 
• may not ask for genetic information from this research and 
• may not use genetic information when making decision about eligibility or premiums

The law will not stop health insurance companies from using genetic information to decide whether to pay claims. The law does not apply to other types of insurance (such as: life, disability or long-term care). 


	
      How long will you be in the study?
      


   You will be in this study for _______.

4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?

















Despite the GINA protections and the best efforts of the research team, there may still be a risk if information about you were to become known to people outside of this study.



Genetic information is unique to you, even without your name or other identifiers. For this reason, genetic information like DNA may be used to identify you and possibly your family members.  We have procedures (such as, labeling your biospecimens with a password protected code known only to select research staff) to prevent people working with your DNA from discovering if it belongs to you. However, there is the risk this can happen as new ways of tracing genetic information are being developed that may make re-identification of genetic information possible.



You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or you are completing questionnaires. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.



      There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.  

5. Are there risks related to pregnancy?



This research may hurt an embryo or fetus in ways we do not currently know. 

6. Are there benefits to being in the study?

	There are no benefits to you from taking part in this study.


If you take part in this study, you may help others in the future.



7. What are your options if you do not want to be in the study?
You do not have to join this study.  If you do not join, your care at Johns Hopkins will not be affected.

8. Will it cost you anything to be in this study?  






You will receive a separate Insurance and Research Participant Financial Responsibility Information Sheet (Sheet). 

This Sheet will give you the following information:

• The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that are part of this research and that will be paid for by the study (no cost to you).  

• The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that will be billed to you and/or your health insurer.  If you have health insurance, you will be responsible for any co-pays or deductibles not covered by your insurance. 

9. Will you be paid if you join this study?

You may be required to provide your social security number to be paid for taking part in this study. Federal tax law requires that you report your research payments when you file your taxes. If your total payments from Johns Hopkins exceed $600 per year, Johns Hopkins will report these payments to the Internal Revenue Service and you will receive a 1099-MISC form from us.



10. Can you leave the study early?
      
      
• You can agree to be in the study now and change your mind later.
• You can leave the study early, but once you leave the study you cannot re-enter the study later.  If you wish to stop, please tell us right away.
• Leaving this study early will not affect the medical care that you would otherwise receive.  
• If you leave the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give out your health information that it already has if the information is needed for this study or any follow-up activities. 


11. Why might we take you out of the study early? 



You may be taken out of the study if:
• Staying in the study would be harmful.
• You need treatment not allowed in the study.
• You fail to follow instructions.
• You become pregnant.
• The study is cancelled.

If you are taken out of the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give out your health information that it already has if the information is needed for this study or any follow-up activities.

12. How will your privacy be protected?


We have rules to protect information about you.  Federal and state laws and the federal medical Privacy Rule also protect your privacy.  By signing this form you provide your permission, called your “authorization,” for the use and disclosure of information protected by the Privacy Rule.

The research team working on the study will collect information about you.  This includes things learned from the procedures described in this consent form.  They may also collect other information including your name, address, date of birth, and information from your medical records. This could include information about HIV and genetic testing, or treatment for drug or alcohol abuse or mental health problems.

The research team will know your identity and that you are in the research study.  Other people at Johns Hopkins, particularly your doctors, may also see or give out your information. We make this information available to your doctors for your safety.   

People outside of Johns Hopkins may need to see or receive your information for this study.  Examples include government agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration), safety monitors, other sites in the study and companies that sponsor the study.

We cannot do this study without your authorization to use and give out your information.  You do not have to give us this authorization.  If you do not, then you may not join this study.

We will use and disclose your information only as described in this form and in our Notice of Privacy Practices; however, people outside Johns Hopkins who receive your information may not be covered by this promise or by the federal Privacy Rule.  We try to make sure that everyone who needs to see your information keeps it confidential – but we cannot guarantee that your information will not be re-disclosed.

The use and disclosure of your information has no time limit. You may revoke (cancel) your permission to use and disclose your information at any time by notifying the Principal Investigator of this study by phone or in writing.  If you contact the Principal Investigator by phone, you must follow-up with a written request that includes the study number and your contact information.  The Principal Investigator’s name, address, phone and fax information are on page one of this consent form. 

If you do cancel your authorization to use and disclose your information, your part in this study will end and no further information about you will be collected. Your revocation (cancellation) would not affect information already collected in the study, or information we disclosed before you wrote to the Principal Investigator to cancel your authorization.

13. Will the study require any of your other health care providers to share your health information with the researchers of this study?


      
As a part of this study, the researchers may ask to see your health care records from your other health care providers.

• Optional: You will be asked to give us a list of other health care providers that you use. 

14. What if there is a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study? 


Insert appropriate agency has given us a Certificate of Confidentiality for this study.  This Certificate adds special protection for research information that identifies you and allows us, in some circumstances, to refuse to give out information that could identify you as a research subject without your consent, when such information is sought in a federal, state, or local court or public agency action. Still, we may disclose identifying information about you if, for example, you need medical help.

We may also disclose identifiable information about you as described in Section 12 of this form or in other cases. For example, the government may see your information if it audits us, and the research team will voluntarily comply with local disclosure laws and will tell the local or state authorities:

• if they suspect abuse, neglect or abandonment of a child or vulnerable or dependent adult;
• if certain diseases are present; and
• if the team learns that you plan to harm someone. In this case, the team also may warn the person who is at risk.

This Certificate does not mean the government approves or disapproves of this research project.

15. What does a conflict of interest mean to you as a participant in this study? 

      A researcher has a financial or other interest in this study.  



In some situations, the results of this study may lead to a financial gain for the researcher and/or Johns Hopkins.  This financial interest has been reviewed in keeping with Johns Hopkins’ policies.  It has been approved with certain conditions, which are intended to guard against bias and to protect participants.

If you have any questions about this financial interest, please talk to name and telephone number of non-financially interested designee. This person is a member of the study team, but does not have a financial interest related to the study. You may also call the Office of Policy Coordination (410-516-5560) for more information. The Office of Policy Coordination reviews financial interests of investigators and/or Johns Hopkins.

16. What treatment costs will be paid if you are injured in this study?

19. What is a Genome-Wide Association Study?



Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) look at the genetic differences that exist in the entire human genome (the complete set of human genes) and the association between these differences and health conditions.  

As part of this study, we will be collecting information about your health and your individual genes. This information will be sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) GWAS database called dbGAP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). 

The aim of collecting this information is to look for genetic connections that:
• may make people more likely to get a certain disease (such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, heart disease or mental illness) or a condition (such as high blood pressure or obesity),
• may affect the progress of a certain disease or condition,
• may affect treatments (medicines, etc.) that work for certain diseases in some people, but not in others. 

We will remove direct identifiers and code your information before sending it to the NIH. NIH will never get this code or the identifiers we have removed. 

Johns Hopkins will not know what types of research will be done with the data that are sent to the database.  

GWAS data will be shared with other researchers world-wide through the dbGaP Database.  This database is kept at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the NIH. 

Researchers must apply to NIH to use the dbGaP database.  Special review committees will look at these applications to decide whether or not to share the data.  Researchers must agree to keep data safe and use the data only for the purpose approved by the NIH.

What are the risks of data being stored for GWAS?
There may be risks to your privacy and the privacy of your relatives from storing your information in a GWAS database.

Although we believe that the NIH privacy measures make this unlikely, there is a risk that your identity could become re-connected with your genetic and health information.  

If this happened -
• Information could be revealed that could lead to denial of employment or insurance for you or a relative, or 
• Law enforcement agencies might be able to demand information about you in connection with an investigation.

Are there benefits to being in a GWAS study?
There is no direct benefit to you from GWAS research.  The information from your data may lead to a better understanding of how genes affect health.  This may help other people in the future.
