[The following paragraph must be precise and customized to fit this study]  In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by [name, social security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier] unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law. Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to you without your permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research organization, will come to inspect your records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the information leaving the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers.  Additionally, the monitors, auditors, the IRB, the Food and Drug Administration will be granted direct access to your medical records for verification of the research procedures and data. By signing this document you are authorizing this access. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name and other identifying information confidential.
For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your protected health information? Your authorization for use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expire.
Will you be able to access your records?
[Use this paragraph for blinded studies or other studies where access will be denied in order to protect the integrity of the research; otherwise delete it:]  During your participation in this study, you will not be able to access your medical records. This will be done to prevent the knowledge of study results from affecting the reliability of the study. Your information will be available should an emergency arise that would require your treating physician to know this information to best treat you. You will have access to your medical record and any study information that is part of that record when the study is over or earlier, if possible. The investigator is not required to release to you research information that is not part of your medical record.
[Use this paragraph for open label studies and other studies for which access will not be denied; otherwise, delete it:]  During your participation in this study, you will have access to your medical record and any study information that is part of that record. The investigator is not required to release to you research information that is not part of your medical record.
Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health information?
NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign this form, and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study. If you do not sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or enrollment in any health plans or affect your eligibility for benefits.
Can you change your mind?
You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use your protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission to use your protected health information for research that means you will also be withdrawn from the research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which you are entitled will not be affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw from the research study at any time without canceling the Authorization to use your data.

It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount Sinai, the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy protection regulations. However, even if your information will no longer be protected by federal regulations, where possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive your information to continue to protect your confidentiality.

If as part of this research project your medical records are being reviewed, or a medical history is being taken, it is possible that HIV-related information may be revealed to the researchers.  If that is the case, the following information concerns you.  If this research does not involve any review of medical records or questions about your medical history or conditions, then the following section may be ignored.
