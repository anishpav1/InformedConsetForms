any reactions that may result. My medical record may be shared with my physician/insurance. For participants attending an educational institution (school/college) or residing in
Senior Living, Assisted Living and/or Skilled Nursing Facility Settings: A copy of this consent may be provided to the institution/Facility for inclusion in your medical record and
continuity of your education and/or treatment/care at the Facility. I am requesting that the immunization(s) be given to me or the person named below for whom I am the legal
guardian. I for myself, my heirs, executors, personal representatives and assigns, hereby release Maxim, any college/university, corporation, physician, and/or medical director
and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions, directors, officers, shareholders and employees, from any and all claims arising out of, in connection with or in any way
related to the services or vaccine(s) provided. I acknowledge that such parties shall not at any time or any extent whatsoever be liable, responsible, or in any way accountable
for any loss, injury, death or damage suffered or sustained by any person at any time in connection therewith. Maxim will use and disclose your personal and health information
to treat you, to receive payment for the care we provide, and for other health care operations. Health care operations generally include those activities we perform to improve the
