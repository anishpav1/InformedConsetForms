INTRODUCTION
State that the purpose of the consent and authorization is to allow the investigator and/or sponsor to follow and gather data regarding the pregnancy and the birth of the child in order to better understand the risks associated with the drug/treatment. Please explain who is conducting the research study.

Example: You are being asked to participate in this follow-up only research study because the biological father of your child was participating in a study when you became pregnant. The name of the study is <<insert name of study>>. We know that <<insert study drug or treatment>> has been known to <<insert any known risks>>. It is possible that your child may be affected. There may be other risks that are unforeseeable. For this reason, we would like to collect medical information about your pregnancy and the birth and health of your child.  We want to follow your pregnancy to try and find out if the <<insert name of drug or treatment>> has any effect on your pregnancy and the health of your child.

Please read this consent carefully and take your time to decide if you want to participate in this follow-up study.

STUDY PROCEDURE
This section should inform the pregnant partner about what they will have to do and what they will experience in the study. Include the length of time that the pregnant partner will be followed. Use simple terms and short sentences. Describe any procedures in detail.

Example: We will review your and your child’s medical records relating to pregnancy, the delivery of your child and the health of your child up to <<insert length of time as stated in the research protocol>>. 

RISKS
Describe any reasonably foreseeable risks. 

Example: There is a risk of the loss of confidentiality of your or your child’s medical record information. 

BENEFITS
Describe any benefits to the participant or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. DO NOT include any compensation to be offered to participants in this section. The description of benefits to the participant should be clear and not overstated to avoid coercion. If no direct benefit is anticipated, it should be stated.

Example: There are no direct benefits to you or your child for taking part in this study. However, we hope that the information we gather about your pregnancy will help future patients and their partners by helping us understand the potential risks of <<insert name of drug/treatment>>.
