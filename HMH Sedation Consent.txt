TO THE PATIENT: You have the right, as a patient, to be informed about your
TM H 1729
condition and the recommended anesthesia/analgesia to be used so that you may
make the decision whether or not to receive the anesthesia/analgesia after knowing the risks and hazards involved.
This disclosure is not meant to scare or alarm you; it is simply an effort to make you better informed so you may
give or withhold your consent to the anesthesia/analgesia.
I voluntarily request anesthesia and/or perioperative pain management care (analgesia) as indicated
below be administered to me (the patient). I understand it will be administered by an anesthesia provider and/or
the operating practitioner, and such other health care providers as necessary. Perioperative means the period
shortly before, during and shortly after the procedure.
I understand that anesthesia/analgesia involves additional risks and hazards but I request the use of
anesthesia/analgesia for the relief and protection from pain during the planned and additional procedures. I realize
the type of anesthesia/analgesia may have to be changed possibly without explanation to me.
I understand that serious, but rare complications can occur with all anesthetic/analgesic methods. Some
of these risks are breathing and heart problems, drug reactions, nerve damage, cardiac arrest, brain damage,
paralysis or death.

I also understand that other complications may occur. Those complications include but are not limited to:
Check planned anesthesia/analgesia rnethod(s) and have the patient/other legally responsible person initial.
